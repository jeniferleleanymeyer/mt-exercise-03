Well done , my lord .
LEONTES .
Though I am satisfied , and need no more Than what I know , yet shall the oracle Give rest to the minds of others , such as he Whose ignorant <unk> will not Come up to th ’ truth .
So have we thought it good From our free person she should be <unk> ’ d , Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence Be left her to perform .
Come , follow us ; We are to speak in public ; for this business Will raise us all .

PAULINA .
A boy ?
EMILIA .

I dare be sworn .
These dangerous <unk> <unk> i ’ th ’ king , beshrew them !
He must be told on ’ t , and he shall : the office Becomes a woman best .

Most worthy madam , Your honour and your goodness is so <unk> , That your free <unk> cannot miss A <unk> issue : there is no lady living So meet for this great errand .
Please your ladyship To visit the next room , I ’ ll presently <unk> the queen of your most noble offer , Who but today <unk> ’ d of this design , But durst not tempt a minister of honour , Lest she should be denied .

EMILIA .
Now be you blest for it !

GAOLER .
Madam , if ’ t please the queen to send the babe , I know not what I shall <unk> to pass it , Having no warrant .
PAULINA .
You need not fear it , sir : This child was prisoner to the womb , and is , By law and process of great nature thence <unk> and <unk> ’ d : not a party to The anger of the king , nor guilty of , If any be , the trespass of the queen .

Enter Paulina carrying a baby , with Antigonus , lords and servants .
FIRST LORD .
You must not enter .
PAULINA .
Nay , rather , good my lords , be second to me : Fear you his tyrannous passion more , alas , Than the queen ’ s life ?

ANTIGONUS .
That ’ s enough .
SERVANT .
Madam , he hath not slept tonight ; commanded None should come at him .
PAULINA .
Not so hot , good sir ; I come to bring him sleep .
’ Tis such as you , That creep like shadows by him , and do sigh At each his needless <unk> , — such as you <unk> the cause of his <unk> .
I Do come with words as med ’ <unk> as true , Honest as either , to purge him of that humour That <unk> him from sleep .
LEONTES .
What noise there , ho ?
PAULINA .
No noise , my lord ; but needful conference About some <unk> for your highness .
LEONTES .
How !
Away with that <unk> lady !
Antigonus , I charg ’ d thee that she should not come about me .
I knew she would .
ANTIGONUS .
I told her so , my lord , On your displeasure ’ s peril and on mine , She should not visit you .
LEONTES .
What , canst not rule her ?
PAULINA .
From all <unk> he can .
In this , Unless he take the course that you have done , Commit me for <unk> honour — trust it , He shall not rule me .
ANTIGONUS .
La you now , you hear .
When she will take the rein I let her run ; But she ’ ll not <unk> .
PAULINA .
Good my liege , I come , — And , I beseech you hear me , who <unk> Myself your loyal servant , your physician , Your most obedient counsellor , yet that dares <unk> appear so , in <unk> your evils , Than such as most seem yours — I say I come From your good queen .

LEONTES .

PAULINA .
Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes First hand me : on mine own accord I ’ ll off ; But first I ’ ll do my errand .
The good queen , ( For she is good ) hath brought you forth a daughter ; Here ’ tis ; commends it to your blessing .
&#91; _ <unk> down the child . _ &#93; LEONTES .
Out !
A mankind witch !
Hence with her , out o ’ door : A most <unk> bawd !
PAULINA .
Not so .
I am as ignorant in that as you In so <unk> me ; and no less honest Than you are mad ; which is enough , I ’ ll warrant , As this world goes , to pass for honest .
LEONTES .

Will you not push her out ?
&#91; _ To Antigonus . _ &#93; Give her the bastard , Thou <unk> !
Thou art <unk> ’ d , <unk> By thy <unk> <unk> here .
Take up the bastard , Take ’ t up , I say ; give ’ t to thy <unk> .
PAULINA .
For ever <unk> be thy hands , if thou <unk> ’ st up the princess by that forced baseness Which he has put upon ’ t !
LEONTES .
He <unk> his wife .
PAULINA .
So I would you did ; then ’ twere past all doubt You ’ d call your children yours .
LEONTES .
A nest of traitors !
ANTIGONUS .
I am none , by this good light .
PAULINA .
Nor I ; nor any But one that ’ s here , and that ’ s himself .
For he The sacred honour of himself , his queen ’ s , His hopeful son ’ s , his babe ’ s , <unk> to slander , Whose sting is <unk> than the sword ’ s ; and will not , ( For , as the case now stands , it is a curse He cannot be compell ’ d to ’ t ) once remove The root of his opinion , which is rotten As ever oak or stone was sound .
LEONTES .
A <unk> Of boundless tongue , who late hath beat her husband , And now <unk> me !
This brat is none of mine ; It is the issue of Polixenes .
Hence with it , and together with the dam Commit them to the fire .
PAULINA .
It is yours ; And , might we lay th ’ old proverb to your charge , So like you ’ tis the worse .
Behold , my lords , Although the print be little , the whole matter And copy of the father : eye , nose , lip , The trick of ’ s frown , his forehead ; nay , the <unk> , The pretty <unk> of his chin and cheek ; his smiles ; The very <unk> and frame of hand , nail , finger : And thou , good goddess Nature , which hast made it So like to him that got it , if thou hast The <unk> of the mind too , ’ mongst all colours No yellow in ’ t , lest she suspect , as he does , Her children not her husband ’ s !
LEONTES .
A gross <unk> !
And , <unk> , thou art worthy to be hang ’ d That wilt not stay her tongue .
ANTIGONUS .
Hang all the husbands That cannot do that feat , you ’ ll leave yourself <unk> one subject .
LEONTES .
Once more , take her hence .
PAULINA .
A most unworthy and unnatural lord Can do no more .
LEONTES .
I ’ ll have thee burnt .
PAULINA .
I care not .
It is an <unk> that makes the fire , Not she which burns in ’ t .
I ’ ll not call you tyrant ; But this most cruel usage of your queen , Not able to produce more accusation Than your own <unk> ’ d fancy , something <unk> Of tyranny , and will <unk> make you , Yea , <unk> to the world .
LEONTES .
On your allegiance , Out of the chamber with her !
Were I a tyrant , Where were her life ?
She durst not call me so , If she did know me one .
Away with her !
PAULINA .
I pray you , do not push me ; I ’ ll be gone .
Look to your babe , my lord ; ’ tis yours : Jove send her A better <unk> spirit !
What needs these hands ?
You that are thus so tender o ’ er his follies , Will never do him good , not one of you .
So , so .
Farewell ; we are gone .
&#91; _ Exit . _ &#93; LEONTES .
Thou , traitor , hast set on thy wife to this .
My child ?
Away with ’ t .
Even thou , that hast A heart so tender o ’ er it , take it hence , And see it instantly <unk> ’ d with fire ; Even thou , and none but thou .
Take it up straight : Within this hour bring me word ’ tis done , And by good testimony , or I ’ ll seize thy life , With that thou else call ’ st thine .
If thou refuse And wilt encounter with my wrath , say so ; The bastard brains with these my proper hands Shall I dash out .
Go , take it to the fire ; For thou set ’ st on thy wife .
ANTIGONUS .
I did not , sir : These lords , my noble fellows , if they please , Can clear me in ’ t .

LEONTES .
You ’ re <unk> all .
FIRST LORD .
Beseech your highness , give us better credit : We have always truly serv ’ d you ; and beseech So to esteem of us .
And on our knees we beg , As recompense of our dear services Past and to come , that you do change this purpose , Which being so horrible , so bloody , must Lead on to some foul issue .
We all kneel .
LEONTES .
I am a feather for each wind that blows .
Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel And call me father ?
better burn it now Than curse it then .
But be it ; let it live .
It shall not neither .
&#91; _ To Antigonus . _ &#93; You , sir , come you hither , You that have been so <unk> <unk> With Lady <unk> , your midwife , there , To save this bastard ’ s life — for ’ tis a bastard , So sure as this beard ’ s grey .

LEONTES .
It shall be possible .
Swear by this sword Thou wilt perform my bidding .
ANTIGONUS .
I will , my lord .
LEONTES .
Mark , and perform it , seest thou ?
for the fail Of any point in ’ t shall not only be Death to thyself , but to thy <unk> ’ d wife , Whom for this time we pardon .
We <unk> thee , As thou art <unk> to us , that thou carry This female bastard hence , and that thou bear it To some remote and desert place , quite out Of our <unk> ; and that there thou leave it , Without more mercy , to it own protection And favour of the <unk> .
As by strange fortune It came to us , I do in justice charge thee , On thy soul ’ s peril and thy body ’ s torture , That thou commend it strangely to some place Where chance may nurse or end it .
Take it up .
ANTIGONUS .
I swear to do this , though a present death Had been more merciful .
Come on , poor babe : Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and <unk> To be thy <unk> !

Sir , be prosperous In more than this deed does require !

LEONTES .
This <unk> ( to our great grief we pronounce ) Even <unk> ’ gainst our heart : the party tried The daughter of a king , our wife , and one Of us too much belov ’ d .
Let us be clear ’ d Of being tyrannous , since we so <unk> Proceed in justice , which shall have due course , Even to the guilt or the <unk> .

OFFICER .
It is his highness ’ pleasure that the queen Appear in person here in court .
Silence !
Hermione is brought in guarded ; Paulina and Ladies attending .
LEONTES .
Read the <unk> .
OFFICER .
&#91; _ Reads . _ &#93; “ Hermione , queen to the worthy Leontes , king of Sicilia , thou art here accused and <unk> of high treason , in <unk> <unk> with Polixenes , king of Bohemia ; and <unk> with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign lord the king , thy royal husband : the pretence whereof being by circumstances partly laid open , thou , Hermione , contrary to the faith and allegiance of a true subject , didst counsel and aid them , for their better safety , to fly away by night . ” HERMIONE .
Since what I am to say must be but that Which <unk> my accusation , and The testimony on my part no other But what comes from myself , it shall scarce boot me To say “ Not guilty ” .
Mine integrity , Being counted falsehood , shall , as I express it , Be so receiv ’ d .
But thus , if powers divine Behold our human actions , as they do , I doubt not , then , but innocence shall make False accusation blush , and tyranny <unk> at patience .
You , my lord , best know , Who least will seem to do so , my past life Hath been as continent , as chaste , as true , As I am now unhappy ; which is more Than history can pattern , though <unk> ’ d And play ’ d to take <unk> .
For behold me , A fellow of the royal bed , which owe A moiety of the throne , a great king ’ s daughter , The mother to a hopeful prince , here standing To prate and talk for life and honour ’ fore Who please to come and hear .
For life , I prize it As I weigh grief , which I would spare .
For honour , ’ Tis a <unk> from me to mine , And only that I stand for .
I appeal To your own conscience , sir , before Polixenes Came to your court , how I was in your grace , How <unk> to be so ; since he came , With what encounter so <unk> I Have strain ’ d t ’ appear thus : if one jot beyond The bound of honour , or in act or will That way <unk> , <unk> ’ d be the hearts Of all that hear me , and my near ’ st of kin Cry fie upon my grave !
LEONTES .
I ne ’ er heard yet That any of these <unk> vices <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> what they did Than to perform it first .
HERMIONE .
That ’ s true enough ; Though ’ tis a saying , sir , not due to me .
LEONTES .
You will not own it .
HERMIONE .
More than mistress of Which comes to me in name of fault , I must not At all acknowledge .
For Polixenes , With whom I am <unk> ’ d , I do confess I lov ’ d him as in honour he <unk> ’ d , With such a kind of love as might become A lady like me ; with a love even such , So and no other , as yourself commanded : Which not to have done , I think had been in me Both <unk> and ingratitude To you and toward your friend , whose love had spoke , Ever since it could speak , from an infant , freely , That it was yours .
Now , for conspiracy , I know not how it <unk> , though it be dish ’ d For me to try how : all I know of it Is that Camillo was an honest man ; And why he left your court , the gods themselves , <unk> no more than I , are ignorant .
LEONTES .
You knew of his departure , as you know What you have <unk> ’ en to do in ’ s absence .
HERMIONE .
Sir , You speak a language that I understand not : My life stands in the level of your dreams , Which I ’ ll lay down .
LEONTES .
Your actions are my dreams .
You had a bastard by Polixenes , And I but dream ’ d it .
As you were past all shame ( Those of your fact are so ) so past all truth , Which to deny concerns more than <unk> ; for as Thy brat hath been cast out , like to itself , No father <unk> it ( which is , indeed , More <unk> in thee than it ) , so thou <unk> feel our justice ; in whose <unk> passage Look for no less than death .
HERMIONE .
Sir , spare your threats : The <unk> which you would fright me with , I seek .
To me can life be no commodity .
The crown and comfort of my life , your favour , I do give lost , for I do feel it gone , But know not how it went .
My second joy , And <unk> of my body , from his presence I am barr ’ d , like one <unk> .
My third comfort , <unk> ’ d most <unk> , is from my breast , ( The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth ) Hal ’ d out to murder ; myself on every post Proclaim ’ d a strumpet ; with <unk> hatred The <unk> privilege denied , which ’ longs To women of all fashion ; <unk> , <unk> Here to this place , i ’ th ’ open air , before I have got strength of limit .
Now , my liege , Tell me what blessings I have here alive , That I should fear to die .
Therefore proceed .
But yet hear this : mistake me not : no life , I prize it not a straw , but for mine honour , Which I would free , if I shall be condemn ’ d Upon <unk> , all proofs sleeping else But what your jealousies awake , I tell you ’ Tis rigour , and not law .
Your honours all , I do <unk> me to the oracle : Apollo be my judge !
FIRST LORD .
This your request Is altogether just : therefore bring forth , And in Apollo ’ s name , his oracle : &#91; _ Exeunt certain Officers . _ &#93; HERMIONE .

O that he were alive , and here beholding His daughter ’ s trial !

SERVANT .

LEONTES .
Apollo ’ s angry , and the heavens themselves Do strike at my injustice .
&#91; _ Hermione faints . _ &#93; How now there ?
PAULINA .
This news is mortal to the queen .
Look down And see what death is doing .
LEONTES .
Take her hence : Her heart is but o ’ <unk> ’ d ; she will recover .
I have too much believ ’ d mine own suspicion .
Beseech you <unk> apply to her Some <unk> for life .
&#91; _ Exeunt Paulina and Ladies with Hermione . _ &#93; Apollo , pardon My great <unk> ’ gainst thine oracle !
I ’ ll reconcile me to Polixenes , New woo my queen , <unk> the good Camillo , Whom I proclaim a man of truth , of mercy ; For , being transported by my jealousies To bloody thoughts and to revenge , I chose Camillo for the minister to poison My friend Polixenes : which had been done , But that the good mind of Camillo <unk> My swift command , though I with death and with <unk> did threaten and <unk> him , Not doing it and being done .

What old or <unk> torture Must I receive , whose every word deserves To taste of thy most worst ?
Thy tyranny , Together working with thy jealousies , <unk> too weak for boys , too green and idle For girls of nine .
O , think what they have done , And then run mad indeed , stark mad !
for all Thy <unk> <unk> were but <unk> of it .
That thou betray ’ dst Polixenes , ’ twas nothing ; That did but show thee , of a fool , inconstant And damnable ingrateful ; nor was ’ t much Thou wouldst have poison ’ d good Camillo ’ s honour , To have him kill a king ; poor <unk> , More monstrous standing by : whereof I reckon The <unk> forth to crows thy baby daughter , To be or none or little , though a devil Would have shed water out of fire ere done ’ t , Nor is ’ t directly laid to thee the death Of the young prince , whose honourable thoughts , <unk> high for one so tender , <unk> the heart That could conceive a gross and foolish sire <unk> ’ d his gracious dam : this is not , no , <unk> to thy answer : but the last — O lords , When I have said , cry Woe ! — the queen , the queen , The sweet ’ st , dear ’ st creature ’ s dead , and vengeance for ’ t Not <unk> ’ d down yet .
FIRST LORD .

PAULINA .
I say she ’ s dead : I ’ ll swear ’ t .
If word nor oath <unk> not , go and see : if you can bring <unk> , or lustre , in her lip , her eye , <unk> <unk> or breath within , I ’ ll serve you As I would do the gods .
But , O thou tyrant !
Do not repent these things , for they are heavier Than all thy woes can stir .
Therefore <unk> thee To nothing but despair .
A thousand knees Ten thousand years together , naked , fasting , Upon a barren mountain , and still winter In storm perpetual , could not move the gods To look that way thou wert .
LEONTES .
Go on , go on : Thou canst not speak too much ; I have deserv ’ d All tongues to talk their <unk> .
FIRST LORD .
Say no more : Howe ’ er the business goes , you have made fault I ’ th ’ boldness of your speech .
PAULINA .
I am sorry for ’ t : All faults I make , when I shall come to know them , I do repent .
Alas , I have show ’ d too much The rashness of a woman : he is touch ’ d To th ’ noble heart .
What ’ s gone and what ’ s past help , Should be past grief .
Do not receive affliction At my petition ; I beseech you , rather Let me be punish ’ d , that have <unk> you Of what you should forget .
Now , good my liege , Sir , royal sir , forgive a foolish woman : The love I bore your queen — lo , fool again !
I ’ ll speak of her no more , nor of your children .
I ’ ll not remember you of my own lord , Who is lost too .
Take your patience to you , And I ’ ll say nothing .
LEONTES .
Thou didst speak but well When most the truth , which I receive much better Than to be pitied of thee .
Prithee , bring me To the dead bodies of my queen and son : One grave shall be for both .
Upon them shall The causes of their death appear , unto Our shame perpetual .
Once a day I ’ ll visit The chapel where they lie , and tears shed there Shall be my <unk> .

The fury spent , anon Did this break from her : “ Good Antigonus , Since fate , against thy better disposition , Hath made thy person for the <unk> Of my poor babe , according to thine oath , <unk> remote enough are in Bohemia , There weep , and leave it crying .
And , for the babe Is counted lost for ever , Perdita I prithee call ’ t .
For this ungentle business , Put on thee by my lord , thou ne ’ er shalt see Thy wife Paulina more . ” And so , with <unk> , She melted into air .
<unk> much , I did in time <unk> myself and thought This was so , and no slumber .
<unk> are toys , Yet for this once , yea , <unk> , I will be <unk> ’ d by this .
I do believe Hermione hath suffer ’ d death , and that Apollo would , this being indeed the issue Of King Polixenes , it should here be laid , Either for life or death , upon the earth Of its right father .
<unk> , speed thee well !
There lie ; and there thy character : there these ; &#91; _ <unk> down the child and a <unk> . _ &#93; Which may if fortune please , both breed thee , pretty , And still rest thine .
The storm begins : poor wretch , That for thy mother ’ s fault art thus <unk> ’ d To loss and what may follow !
<unk> I cannot , But my heart <unk> , and most <unk> ’ d am I To be by oath <unk> ’ d to this .
Farewell !
The day frowns more and more .
Thou ’ rt like to have A <unk> too rough .
I never saw The heavens so dim by day .
A savage clamour !
Well may I get aboard !
This is the chase : I am gone for ever .
&#91; _ Exit , pursued by a bear . _ &#93; Enter an old Shepherd .
SHEPHERD .
I would there were no age between ten and <unk> , or that youth would sleep out the rest ; for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches with child , <unk> the <unk> , stealing , fighting — Hark you now !
Would any but these <unk> brains of <unk> and <unk> hunt this weather ?
They have <unk> away two of my best sheep , which I fear the wolf will sooner find than the master : if anywhere I have them , ’ tis by the <unk> , <unk> of <unk> .
Good luck , an ’ t be thy will , what have we here ?
&#91; _ Taking up the child . _ &#93; Mercy on ’ s , a <unk> !
A very pretty <unk> !
A boy or a child , I wonder ?
A pretty one ; a very pretty one .
Sure , some scape .
Though I am not <unk> , yet I can read <unk> in the scape .
This has been some <unk> , some <unk> , some <unk> .
They were <unk> that got this than the poor thing is here .
I ’ ll take it up for pity : yet I ’ ll tarry till my son come ; he <unk> but even now .
<unk> !
Enter Clown .
CLOWN .
<unk> , <unk> !
SHEPHERD .
What , art so near ?
If thou ’ lt see a thing to talk on when thou art dead and rotten , come hither .
What <unk> ’ st thou , man ?
CLOWN .
I have seen two such sights , by sea and by land !
But I am not to say it is a sea , for it is now the sky : betwixt the <unk> and it , you cannot thrust a <unk> ’ s point .
SHEPHERD .
Why , boy , how is it ?
CLOWN .
I would you did but see how it <unk> , how it rages , how it takes up the shore !
But that ’ s not to the point .
O , the most piteous cry of the poor souls !
sometimes to see ’ em , and not to see ’ em .
Now the ship <unk> the moon with her <unk> , and anon swallowed with <unk> and <unk> , as you ’ d thrust a <unk> into a <unk> .
And then for the land service , to see how the bear <unk> out his <unk> , how he cried to me for help , and said his name was Antigonus , a nobleman .
But to make an end of the ship , to see how the sea <unk> ’ d it : but first , how the poor souls roared , and the sea mocked them , and how the poor gentleman roared , and the bear mocked him , both roaring louder than the sea or weather .
SHEPHERD .
Name of mercy , when was this , boy ?
CLOWN .
Now , now .
I have not <unk> since I saw these sights : the men are not yet cold under water , nor the bear half dined on the gentleman .
He ’ s at it now .
SHEPHERD .
Would I had been by to have <unk> the old man !
CLOWN .
I would you had been by the ship side , to have <unk> her : there your charity would have lacked footing .
SHEPHERD .
<unk> matters , heavy matters !
But look thee here , boy .
Now bless thyself : thou met ’ st with things dying , I with things <unk> .
Here ’ s a sight for thee .
Look thee , a <unk> for a squire ’ s child !
Look thee here ; take up , take up , boy ; open ’ t .
So , let ’ s see .
It was told me I should be rich by the fairies .
This is some <unk> : open ’ t .
What ’ s within , boy ?
CLOWN .
You ’ re a made old man .
If the sins of your youth are <unk> you , you ’ re well to live .
<unk> !
all gold !
SHEPHERD .
This is fairy gold , boy , and ’ twill prove so .
Up with it , keep it close : home , home , the next way .
We are <unk> , boy , and to be so still requires nothing but secrecy .
Let my sheep go : come , good boy , the next way home .
CLOWN .
Go you the next way with your <unk> .
I ’ ll go see if the bear be gone from the gentleman , and how much he hath eaten .
They are never curst but when they are hungry : if there be any of him left , I ’ ll bury it .
SHEPHERD .
That ’ s a good deed .
If thou <unk> discern by that which is left of him what he is , fetch me to th ’ sight of him .
CLOWN .
Marry , will I ; and you shall help to put him i ’ th ’ ground .
SHEPHERD .
’ Tis a <unk> day , boy , and we ’ ll do good deeds on ’ t .
&#91; _ Exeunt . _ &#93; ACT IV SCENE I.
Enter Time , the Chorus .
<unk> .
I that please some , try all : both joy and terror Of good and bad , that makes and <unk> error , Now take upon me , in the name of Time , To use my wings .
<unk> it not a crime To me or my swift passage , that I <unk> O ’ er sixteen years , and leave the growth <unk> Of that wide gap , since it is in my power To o ’ <unk> law , and in one <unk> hour To plant and o ’ <unk> custom .
Let me pass The same I am , ere ancient ’ st order was Or what is now received .
I witness to The times that brought them in ; so shall I do To th ’ <unk> things now <unk> , and make stale The <unk> of this present , as my tale Now seems to it .
Your patience this <unk> , I turn my glass , and give my scene such growing As you had slept between .
Leontes leaving Th ’ effects of his fond jealousies , so <unk> That he <unk> up himself , imagine me , Gentle <unk> , that I now may be In fair Bohemia , and remember well , I <unk> a son o ’ th ’ king ’ s , which Florizel I now name to you ; and with speed so pace To speak of Perdita , now grown in grace <unk> with <unk> .
What of her <unk> I list not prophesy ; but let Time ’ s news Be known when ’ tis brought forth .
A shepherd ’ s daughter , And what to her <unk> , which follows after , Is th ’ argument of Time .
Of this allow , If ever you have spent time worse ere now ; If never , yet that Time himself doth say He wishes earnestly you never may .
&#91; _ Exit . _ &#93; SCENE II .
Bohemia .
A Room in the palace of Polixenes .
Enter Polixenes and Camillo .
POLIXENES .
I pray thee , good Camillo , be no more <unk> : ’ tis a sickness <unk> thee anything ; a death to grant this .
CAMILLO .
It is fifteen years since I saw my country .
Though I have for the most part been <unk> abroad , I desire to lay my bones there .
Besides , the penitent king , my master , hath sent for me ; to whose feeling sorrows I might be some allay , or I o ’ <unk> to think so , — which is another spur to my departure .
POLIXENES .
As thou lov ’ st me , Camillo , wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now : the need I have of thee , thine own goodness hath made ; better not to have had thee than thus to want thee .
Thou , having made me <unk> which none without thee can <unk> manage , must either stay to execute them thyself , or take away with thee the very services thou hast done , which if I have not enough considered ( as too much I cannot ) to be more thankful to thee shall be my study ; and my profit therein the <unk> <unk> .
Of that fatal country Sicilia , prithee speak no more ; whose very <unk> <unk> me with the remembrance of that penitent , as thou call ’ st him , and <unk> king , my brother ; whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be <unk> <unk> .
Say to me , when <unk> thou the Prince Florizel , my son ?
Kings are no less unhappy , their issue not being gracious , than they are in losing them when they have approved their virtues .
CAMILLO .
Sir , it is three days since I saw the prince .
What his happier affairs may be , are to me unknown , but I have <unk> noted he is of late much retired from court , and is less <unk> to his princely <unk> than formerly he hath appeared .
POLIXENES .
I have considered so much , Camillo , and with some care ; so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his <unk> ; from whom I have this intelligence , that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd , a man , they say , that from very nothing , and beyond the imagination of his neighbours , is grown into an <unk> estate .
CAMILLO .
I have heard , sir , of such a man , who hath a daughter of most rare note : the report of her is <unk> more than can be thought to begin from such a <unk> .
POLIXENES .
That ’ s likewise part of my intelligence : but , I fear , the angle that plucks our son thither .
Thou shalt <unk> us to the place , where we will , not <unk> what we are , have some question with the shepherd ; from whose simplicity I think it not <unk> to get the cause of my son ’ s resort thither .
Prithee , be my present partner in this business , and lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia .
CAMILLO .
I willingly obey your command .
POLIXENES .
My best Camillo !
We must disguise ourselves .
&#91; _ Exeunt . _ &#93; SCENE III .
The same .
A <unk> near the Shepherd ’ s <unk> .
Enter <unk> , singing .
AUTOLYCUS .
_ When <unk> begin to peer , With , hey !
the <unk> over the <unk> , Why , then comes in the sweet o ’ the year , For the red blood reigns in the winter ’ s pale . _ _ The white sheet <unk> on the hedge , With , hey !
the sweet birds , O , how they sing !
Doth set my <unk> tooth on edge ; For a <unk> of ale is a dish for a king . _ _ The lark , that <unk> <unk> , With , hey !
with , hey !
the <unk> and the <unk> , Are summer songs for me and my <unk> , While we lie <unk> in the hay . _ I have served Prince Florizel , and in my time wore <unk> , but now I am out of service .
_ But shall I go mourn for that , my dear ?
The pale moon shines by night : And when I wander here and there , I then do most go right . _ _ If <unk> may have leave to live , And bear the <unk> <unk> , Then my account I well may give And in the stocks avouch it . _ My traffic is sheets ; when the <unk> <unk> , look to lesser linen .
My father named me <unk> ; who being , I as am , <unk> under Mercury , was likewise a <unk> of <unk> trifles .
With die and <unk> I purchased this <unk> , and my revenue is the silly <unk> .
<unk> and knock are too powerful on the <unk> .
<unk> and hanging are <unk> to me .
For the life to come , I sleep out the thought of it .
A prize !
a prize !
Enter Clown .
CLOWN .
Let me see : every ’ <unk> <unk> <unk> ; every <unk> yields pound and odd <unk> ; fifteen hundred <unk> , what comes the <unk> to ?
AUTOLYCUS .
&#91; _ Aside . _ &#93; If the <unk> hold , the cock ’ s mine .
CLOWN .
I cannot do ’ t without <unk> .
Let me see ; what am I to buy for our <unk> feast ?
“ Three pound of sugar , five pound of <unk> , <unk> ” — what will this sister of mine do with <unk> ?
But my father hath made her mistress of the feast , and she lays it on .
She hath made me <unk> <unk> for the <unk> , <unk> <unk> all , and very good ones ; but they are most of them means and <unk> , but one <unk> amongst them , and he sings <unk> to <unk> .
I must have <unk> to colour the <unk> <unk> ; “ <unk> ; <unk> ” , none , that ’ s out of my note ; “ <unk> , seven ; a race or two of <unk> ” , but that I may beg ; “ four pound of <unk> , and as many of <unk> o ’ th ’ sun . ” AUTOLYCUS .
&#91; _ <unk> on the ground . _ &#93; O that ever I was born !
CLOWN .
I ’ th ’ name of me !
AUTOLYCUS .
O , help me , help me !
Pluck but off these rags ; and then , death , death !
CLOWN .
Alack , poor soul !
thou hast need of more rags to lay on thee , rather than have these off .
AUTOLYCUS .
O sir , the <unk> of them <unk> me more than the <unk> I have received , which are mighty ones and <unk> .
CLOWN .
Alas , poor man !
a million of beating may come to a great matter .
AUTOLYCUS .
I am robbed , sir , and beaten ; my money and apparel ta ’ en from me , and these <unk> things put upon me .
CLOWN .
What , by a <unk> or a <unk> ?
AUTOLYCUS .
A <unk> , sweet sir , a <unk> .
CLOWN .
Indeed , he should be a <unk> by the garments he has left with thee : if this be a <unk> ’ s coat , it hath seen very hot service .
Lend me thy hand , I ’ ll help thee : come , lend me thy hand .
&#91; _ <unk> him up . _ &#93; AUTOLYCUS .
O , good sir , <unk> , O !
CLOWN .
Alas , poor soul !
AUTOLYCUS .
O , good sir , softly , good sir .
I fear , sir , my shoulder blade is out .
CLOWN .
How now !
canst stand ?
AUTOLYCUS .
<unk> , dear sir !
&#91; _ <unk> his pocket . _ &#93; good sir , softly .
You ha ’ done me a charitable office .
CLOWN .
Dost lack any money ?
I have a little money for thee .
AUTOLYCUS .
No , good sweet sir ; no , I beseech you , sir : I have a kinsman not past <unk> of a mile hence , unto whom I was going .
I shall there have money or anything I want .
<unk> me no money , I pray you ; that kills my heart .
CLOWN .
What manner of fellow was he that robbed you ?
AUTOLYCUS .
A fellow , sir , that I have known to go about with <unk> .
I knew him once a servant of the prince ; I cannot tell , good sir , for which of his virtues it was , but he was certainly whipped out of the court .
CLOWN .
His vices , you would say ; there ’ s no virtue whipped out of the court .
They cherish it to make it stay there ; and yet it will no more but abide .
AUTOLYCUS .
<unk> , I would say , sir .
I know this man well .
He hath been since an <unk> , then a <unk> , a <unk> .
Then he <unk> a motion of the <unk> Son , and married a tinker ’ s wife within a mile where my land and living lies ; and , having <unk> over many <unk> <unk> , he settled only in rogue .
Some call him <unk> .
CLOWN .
Out upon him !
<unk> , for my life , <unk> : he haunts wakes , <unk> , and <unk> .
AUTOLYCUS .
Very true , sir ; he , sir , he ; that ’ s the rogue that put me into this apparel .
CLOWN .
Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia .
If you had but looked big and spit at him , he ’ d have run .
AUTOLYCUS .
I must confess to you , sir , I am no <unk> .
I am false of heart that way ; and that he knew , I warrant him .
CLOWN .
How do you now ?
AUTOLYCUS .
Sweet sir , much better than I was .
I can stand and walk : I will even take my leave of you and pace softly towards my kinsman ’ s .
CLOWN .
Shall I bring thee on the way ?
AUTOLYCUS .
No , <unk> sir ; no , sweet sir .
CLOWN .
Then fare thee well .
I must go buy <unk> for our <unk> .
AUTOLYCUS .
<unk> you , sweet sir !
&#91; _ Exit Clown . _ &#93; Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your <unk> .
I ’ ll be with you at your <unk> too .
If I make not this <unk> bring out another , and the <unk> prove sheep , let me be <unk> , and my name put in the book of virtue !
&#91; _ Sings . _ &#93; _ <unk> on , <unk> on , the <unk> way , And merrily <unk> the <unk> : A merry heart goes all the day , Your sad <unk> in a <unk> . _ &#91; _ Exit . _ &#93; SCENE IV .
The same .
A Shepherd ’ s <unk> .
Enter Florizel and Perdita .
FLORIZEL .
These your <unk> weeds to each part of you Do give a life , no <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in April ’ s front .
This your <unk> Is as a meeting of the petty gods , And you the queen on ’ t .
PERDITA .
Sir , my gracious lord , To chide at your extremes it not becomes me ; O , pardon that I name them !
Your high self , The gracious mark o ’ th ’ land , you have <unk> ’ d With a swain ’ s wearing , and me , poor lowly maid , Most <unk> <unk> ’ d up .
But that our feasts In every mess have folly , and the <unk> <unk> it with a custom , I should blush To see you so <unk> ’ d ; swoon , I think , To show myself a glass .
FLORIZEL .
I bless the time When my good falcon made her flight <unk> Thy father ’ s ground .
PERDITA .
Now Jove afford you cause !
To me the difference <unk> dread .
Your greatness Hath not been us ’ d to fear .
Even now I tremble To think your father , by some accident , Should pass this way , as you did .
O , the <unk> !
How would he look to see his work , so noble , <unk> bound up ?
What would he say ?
Or how Should I , in these my borrow ’ d <unk> , behold The <unk> of his presence ?
FLORIZEL .
<unk> Nothing but <unk> .
The gods themselves , <unk> their <unk> to love , have taken The shapes of beasts upon them .
Jupiter <unk> a bull and <unk> ’ d ; the green Neptune A <unk> and <unk> ; and the <unk> ’ d god , <unk> Apollo , a poor humble swain , As I seem now .
Their <unk> Were never for a piece of beauty <unk> , Nor in a way so chaste , since my desires Run not before mine honour , nor my <unk> <unk> <unk> than my faith .
PERDITA .
O , but , sir , Your resolution cannot hold when ’ tis <unk> ’ d , as it must be , by the power of the king : One of these two must be necessities , Which then will speak , that you must change this purpose , Or I my life .
FLORIZEL .
Thou dearest Perdita , With these forc ’ d thoughts , I prithee , <unk> not The mirth o ’ th ’ feast .
Or I ’ ll be thine , my fair , Or not my father ’ s .
For I cannot be Mine own , nor anything to any , if I be not thine .
To this I am most constant , Though destiny say no .
Be merry , gentle .
<unk> such thoughts as these with anything That you behold the while .
Your guests are coming : <unk> up your countenance , as it were the day Of <unk> of that nuptial which We two have sworn shall come .
PERDITA .
O lady Fortune , Stand you <unk> !
FLORIZEL .
See , your guests approach : <unk> yourself to entertain them <unk> , And let ’ s be red with mirth .
Enter Shepherd with Polixenes and Camillo , disguised ; Clown , <unk> , <unk> with others .
SHEPHERD .
Fie , daughter !
When my old wife liv ’ d , upon This day she was both <unk> , <unk> , cook , Both dame and servant ; <unk> ’ d all ; serv ’ d all ; Would sing her song and dance her turn ; now here At upper end o ’ th ’ table , now i ’ th ’ middle ; On his shoulder , and his ; her face o ’ fire With labour , and the thing she took to quench it She would to each one <unk> .
You are retired , As if you were a <unk> one , and not The hostess of the meeting : pray you , bid These unknown friends to ’ s welcome , for it is A way to make us better friends , more known .
Come , quench your blushes , and present yourself That which you are , mistress o ’ th ’ feast .
Come on , And bid us welcome to your <unk> , As your good flock shall prosper .
PERDITA .
&#91; _ To Polixenes . _ &#93; Sir , welcome .
It is my father ’ s will I should take on me The <unk> o ’ the day .
&#91; _ To Camillo . _ &#93; You ’ re welcome , sir .
Give me those flowers there , <unk> .
<unk> sirs , For you there ’ s <unk> and rue ; these keep <unk> and savour all the winter long .
Grace and remembrance be to you both !
And welcome to our <unk> !
POLIXENES .
<unk> — A fair one are you — well you fit our ages With flowers of winter .
PERDITA .
Sir , the year growing ancient , Not yet on summer ’ s death nor on the birth Of trembling winter , the fairest flowers o ’ th ’ season Are our <unk> and <unk> ’ d <unk> , Which some call nature ’ s bastards : of that kind Our <unk> garden ’ s barren ; and I care not To get <unk> of them .
POLIXENES .
Wherefore , gentle maiden , Do you neglect them ?
PERDITA .
For I have heard it said There is an art which , in their <unk> , <unk> With great <unk> nature .
POLIXENES .
Say there be ; Yet nature is made better by no mean But nature makes that mean .
So , over that art Which you say <unk> to nature , is an art That nature makes .
You see , sweet maid , we marry A gentler <unk> to the <unk> stock , And make conceive a bark of baser kind By bud of nobler race .
This is an art Which does mend nature , change it rather , but The art itself is nature .
PERDITA .
So it is .
POLIXENES .
Then make your garden rich in <unk> , And do not call them bastards .
PERDITA .
I ’ ll not put The <unk> in earth to set one slip of them ; No more than , were I painted , I would wish This youth should say ’ twere well , and only therefore Desire to breed by me .
Here ’ s flowers for you : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , The <unk> , that goes to bed with th ’ sun And with him rises weeping .
These are flowers Of middle summer , and I think they are given To men of middle age .
You ’ re very welcome .
CAMILLO .
I should leave <unk> , were I of your flock , And only live by gazing .
PERDITA .
Out , alas !
You ’ d be so lean that blasts of <unk> Would blow you through and through .
&#91; _ To Florizel _ &#93; Now , my fair ’ st friend , I would I had some flowers o ’ th ’ spring , that might Become your time of day ; and yours , and yours , That wear upon your virgin branches yet Your <unk> growing .
O <unk> , From the flowers now that , frighted , thou let ’ st fall From <unk> ’ s <unk> !
<unk> , That come before the swallow dares , and take The winds of March with beauty ; violets dim , But sweeter than the <unk> of Juno ’ s eyes Or <unk> ’ s breath ; pale <unk> , That die <unk> ere they can behold <unk> Phoebus in his strength ( a malady Most <unk> to maids ) ; bold <unk> and The crown imperial ; <unk> of all kinds , The <unk> being one .
O , these I lack , To make you garlands of ; and my sweet friend , To strew him o ’ er and o ’ er !
FLORIZEL .
What , like a corse ?
PERDITA .
No , like a bank for love to lie and play on ; Not like a corse ; or if , not to be buried , But quick , and in mine arms .
Come , take your flowers .
Methinks I play as I have seen them do In <unk> <unk> .
Sure this robe of mine Does change my disposition .
FLORIZEL .
What you do Still betters what is done .
When you speak , sweet , I ’ d have you do it ever .
When you sing , I ’ d have you buy and sell so , so give alms , Pray so ; and , for the <unk> ’ ring your affairs , To sing them too .
When you do dance , I wish you A wave o ’ th ’ sea , that you might ever do Nothing but that , move still , still so , And own no other function .
Each your doing , So <unk> in each particular , <unk> what you are doing in the present deeds , That all your acts are queens .
PERDITA .
O <unk> , Your praises are too large .
But that your youth , And the true blood which <unk> fairly through ’ t , Do plainly give you out an <unk> shepherd , With wisdom I might fear , my <unk> , You woo ’ d me the false way .
FLORIZEL .
I think you have As little skill to fear as I have purpose To put you to ’ t .
But , come ; our dance , I pray .
Your hand , my Perdita .
So <unk> pair That never mean to part .
PERDITA .
I ’ ll swear for ’ em .
POLIXENES .
This is the prettiest <unk> lass that ever <unk> on the <unk> .
Nothing she does or seems But <unk> of something greater than herself , Too noble for this place .
CAMILLO .
He tells her something That makes her blood look out .
Good sooth , she is The queen of <unk> and <unk> .
CLOWN .
Come on , strike up .
DORCAS .
<unk> must be your mistress : marry , <unk> , to mend her kissing with !
MOPSA .
Now , in good time !
CLOWN .
Not a word , a word ; we stand upon our manners .
Come , strike up .
&#91; _ Music .
Here a dance Of <unk> and <unk> . _ &#93; POLIXENES .
Pray , good shepherd , what fair swain is this Which dances with your daughter ?
SHEPHERD .
They call him <unk> ; and <unk> himself To have a worthy feeding .
But I have it Upon his own report , and I believe it .
He looks like sooth .
He says he loves my daughter .
I think so too ; for never <unk> ’ d the moon Upon the water as he ’ ll stand and read , As ’ twere , my daughter ’ s eyes .
And , to be plain , I think there is not half a kiss to choose Who loves another best .
POLIXENES .
She dances <unk> .
SHEPHERD .
So she does anything , though I report it That should be silent .
If young <unk> Do light upon her , she shall bring him that Which he not dreams of .
Enter a Servant .
SERVANT .
O master , if you did but hear the <unk> at the door , you would never dance again after a tabor and pipe ; no , the <unk> could not move you .
He sings several tunes faster than you ’ ll tell money .
He <unk> them as he had eaten <unk> , and all men ’ s ears grew to his tunes .
CLOWN .
He could never come better : he shall come in .
I love a ballad but even too well , if it be <unk> matter merrily set down , or a very pleasant thing indeed and sung <unk> .
SERVANT .
He hath songs for man or woman of all <unk> .
No <unk> can so fit his <unk> with gloves .
He has the prettiest <unk> for maids , so without <unk> , which is strange ; with such delicate <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , “ jump her and <unk> her ” ; and where some <unk> rascal would , as it were , mean mischief and break a foul gap into the matter , he makes the maid to answer “ <unk> , do me no harm , good man ” ; puts him off , <unk> him , with “ <unk> , do me no harm , good man . ” POLIXENES .
This is a brave fellow .
CLOWN .
Believe me , thou <unk> of an admirable <unk> fellow .
Has he any <unk> <unk> ?
SERVANT .
He hath <unk> of all the colours i ’ th ’ <unk> ; points , more than all the <unk> in Bohemia can <unk> handle , though they come to him by th ’ gross ; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ; why he sings ’ em over as they were gods or <unk> ; you would think a <unk> were a <unk> , he so <unk> to the <unk> and the work about the square on ’ t .
CLOWN .
Prithee bring him in ; and let him approach singing .
PERDITA .
<unk> him that he use no <unk> words in ’ s tunes .
&#91; _ Exit Servant . _ &#93; CLOWN .
You have of these <unk> that have more in them than you ’ d think , sister .
PERDITA .
Ay , good brother , or go about to think .
Enter <unk> , singing .
AUTOLYCUS .
_ <unk> as white as driven snow , <unk> black as e ’ er was crow , <unk> as sweet as <unk> roses , <unk> for faces and for noses , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> for a lady ’ s chamber , <unk> <unk> and <unk> For my lads to give their <unk> , <unk> and <unk> of steel , What maids lack from head to heel .
Come buy of me , come ; come buy , come buy ; <unk> , lads , or else your <unk> cry .
Come , buy . _ CLOWN .
If I were not in love with <unk> , thou shouldst take no money of me ; but being <unk> as I am , it will also be the bondage of certain <unk> and gloves .
MOPSA .
I was promised them against the feast ; but they come not too late now .
DORCAS .
He hath promised you more than that , or there be <unk> .
MOPSA .
He hath paid you all he promised you .
<unk> he has paid you more , which will shame you to give him again .
CLOWN .
Is there no manners left among maids ?
Will they wear their <unk> where they should bear their faces ?
Is there not <unk> , when you are going to bed , or <unk> , to whistle of these secrets , but you must be <unk> before all our guests ?
’ Tis well they are <unk> .
<unk> your tongues , and not a word more .
MOPSA .
I have done .
Come , you promised me a <unk> <unk> and a pair of sweet gloves .
CLOWN .
Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way and lost all my money ?
AUTOLYCUS .
And indeed , sir , there are <unk> abroad ; therefore it <unk> men to be wary .
CLOWN .
Fear not thou , man .
Thou shalt lose nothing here .
AUTOLYCUS .
I hope so , sir ; for I have about me many parcels of charge .
CLOWN .
What hast here ?
<unk> ?
MOPSA .
Pray now , buy some .
I love a ballad in print <unk> , for then we are sure they are true .
AUTOLYCUS .
Here ’ s one to a very <unk> tune .
How a usurer ’ s wife was brought to bed of twenty <unk> at a burden , and how she <unk> to eat <unk> ’ heads and <unk> <unk> .
MOPSA .
Is it true , think you ?
AUTOLYCUS .
Very true , and but a month old .
DORCAS .
Bless me from marrying a usurer !
AUTOLYCUS .
Here ’ s the midwife ’ s name to ’ t , one Mistress <unk> , and five or six honest wives that were present .
Why should I carry lies abroad ?
MOPSA .
Pray you now , buy it .
CLOWN .
Come on , lay it by ; and let ’ s first see more <unk> .
We ’ ll buy the other things anon .
AUTOLYCUS .
Here ’ s another ballad , of a fish that appeared upon the coast on Wednesday the fourscore of April , forty thousand fathom above water , and sung this ballad against the hard hearts of maids .
It was thought she was a woman , and was turned into a cold fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that loved her .
The ballad is very pitiful , and as true .
DORCAS .
Is it true too , think you ?
AUTOLYCUS .
Five justices ’ hands at it , and witnesses more than my pack will hold .
CLOWN .
Lay it by too : another .
AUTOLYCUS .
This is a merry ballad ; but a very pretty one .
MOPSA .
Let ’ s have some merry ones .
AUTOLYCUS .
Why , this is a passing merry one and goes to the tune of “ Two maids wooing a man . ” There ’ s scarce a maid <unk> but she sings it .
’ Tis in request , I can tell you .
MOPSA .
We can both sing it : if thou ’ lt bear a part , thou shalt hear ; ’ tis in three parts .
DORCAS .
We had the tune on ’ t a month ago .
AUTOLYCUS .
I can bear my part ; you must know ’ tis my occupation : have at it with you .
SONG .
AUTOLYCUS .
_ Get you hence , for I must go Where it fits not you to know . _ DORCAS .
_ Whither ? _ MOPSA .
_ O , whither ? _ DORCAS .
_ Whither ? _ MOPSA .
_ It becomes thy oath full well Thou to me thy secrets tell . _ DORCAS .
_ Me too !
Let me go thither . _ MOPSA .
Or thou goest to th ’ <unk> or <unk> .
DORCAS .
_ If to either , thou dost ill . _ AUTOLYCUS .
_ Neither . _ DORCAS .
_ What , neither ? _ AUTOLYCUS .
_ Neither . _ DORCAS .
_ Thou hast sworn my love to be . _ MOPSA .
_ Thou hast sworn it more to me .
Then whither goest ?
Say , whither ? _ CLOWN .
We ’ ll have this song out anon by ourselves .
My father and the gentlemen are in sad talk , and we ’ ll not trouble them .
Come , bring away thy pack after me .
<unk> , I ’ ll buy for you both .
<unk> , let ’ s have the first choice .
Follow me , girls .
&#91; _ Exit with <unk> and <unk> . _ &#93; AUTOLYCUS .
&#91; _ Aside . _ &#93; And you shall pay well for ’ em .
SONG .
_ Will you buy any <unk> , Or <unk> for your <unk> , My dainty duck , my <unk> ?
Any silk , any thread , Any toys for your head , Of the new ’ st and <unk> ’ st , <unk> ’ st <unk> ?
Come to the <unk> ; <unk> ’ s a <unk> That doth utter all men ’ s <unk> . _ &#91; _ Exit . _ &#93; Enter Servant .
SERVANT .
Master , there is three <unk> , three shepherds , three <unk> , three <unk> , that have made themselves all men of hair .
They call themselves <unk> , and they have dance which the wenches say is a <unk> of <unk> , because they are not in ’ t ; but they themselves are o ’ the mind ( if it be not too rough for some that know little but <unk> ) it will please <unk> .
SHEPHERD .
Away !
we ’ ll none on ’ t .
Here has been too much homely foolery already .
I know , sir , we weary you .
POLIXENES .
You weary those that <unk> us : pray , let ’ s see these four <unk> of <unk> .
SERVANT .
One three of them , by their own report , sir , hath <unk> before the king ; and not the worst of the three but <unk> twelve foot and a half by th ’ square .
SHEPHERD .
Leave your prating : since these good men are pleased , let them come in ; but quickly now .
SERVANT .
Why , they stay at door , sir .
&#91; _ Exit . _ &#93; Enter <unk> <unk> , <unk> like <unk> .
They dance , and then <unk> .
POLIXENES .
O , father , you ’ ll know more of that hereafter .
&#91; _ To Camillo . _ &#93; Is it not too far gone ?
’ Tis time to part them .
He ’ s simple and tells much .
&#91; _ To Florizel . _ &#93; How now , fair shepherd !
Your heart is full of something that does take Your mind from feasting .
<unk> , when I was young And <unk> love , as you do , I was wont To load my she with <unk> : I would have <unk> ’ d The <unk> ’ s silken <unk> and have pour ’ d it To her acceptance .
You have let him go , And nothing <unk> with him .
If your lass <unk> should abuse , and call this Your lack of love or bounty , you were <unk> For a reply , at least if you make a care Of happy holding her .
FLORIZEL .
Old sir , I know She <unk> not such trifles as these are : The gifts she looks from me are pack ’ d and lock ’ d Up in my heart , which I have given already , But not deliver ’ d .
O , hear me breathe my life Before this ancient sir , who , it should seem , Hath sometime lov ’ d .
I take thy hand !
this hand , As soft as dove ’ s down and as white as it , Or <unk> ’ s tooth , or the <unk> ’ d snow that ’ s <unk> By th ’ northern blasts twice o ’ er .
POLIXENES .
What follows this ?
How <unk> the young swain seems to wash The hand was fair before !
I have put you out .
But to your <unk> .
Let me hear What you profess .
FLORIZEL .
Do , and be witness to ’ t .
POLIXENES .
And this my neighbour , too ?
FLORIZEL .
And he , and more Than he , and men , the earth , the heavens , and all : That were I crown ’ d the most imperial monarch , <unk> most worthy , were I the fairest youth That ever made eye <unk> , had force and knowledge More than was ever man ’ s , I would not prize them Without her love ; for her employ them all ; Commend them and condemn them to her service , Or to their own <unk> .
POLIXENES .
<unk> offer ’ d .
CAMILLO .
This shows a sound affection .
SHEPHERD .
But my daughter , Say you the like to him ?
PERDITA .
I cannot speak So well , nothing so well ; no , nor mean better : By th ’ pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out The purity of his .
SHEPHERD .
Take hands , a bargain !
And , friends unknown , you shall bear witness to ’ t .
I give my daughter to him , and will make Her <unk> equal his .
FLORIZEL .
O , that must be I ’ th ’ virtue of your daughter : one being dead , I shall have more than you can dream of yet ; Enough then for your wonder .
But come on , <unk> us ’ fore these witnesses .
SHEPHERD .
Come , your hand ; And , daughter , yours .
POLIXENES .
Soft , swain , awhile , beseech you ; Have you a father ?
FLORIZEL .
I have ; but what of him ?
POLIXENES .
Knows he of this ?
FLORIZEL .
He neither does nor shall .
POLIXENES .
Methinks a father Is at the nuptial of his son a guest That best becomes the table .
Pray you once more , Is not your father grown <unk> Of reasonable affairs ?
is he not <unk> With age and <unk> ’ ring <unk> ?
can he speak ?
hear ?
Know man from man ?
<unk> his own estate ?
Lies he not <unk> ?
and again does nothing But what he did being childish ?
FLORIZEL .
No , good sir ; He has his health , and <unk> strength indeed Than most have of his age .
POLIXENES .
By my white beard , You offer him , if this be so , a wrong Something <unk> : reason my son Should choose himself a wife , but as good reason The father , all whose joy is nothing else But fair posterity , should hold some counsel In such a business .
FLORIZEL .
I yield all this ; But for some other reasons , my grave sir , Which ’ tis not fit you know , I not acquaint My father of this business .
POLIXENES .
Let him know ’ t .
FLORIZEL .
He shall not .
POLIXENES .
Prithee let him .
FLORIZEL .
No , he must not .
SHEPHERD .
Let him , my son : he shall not need to grieve At knowing of thy choice .
FLORIZEL .
Come , come , he must not .
Mark our contract .
POLIXENES .
&#91; _ <unk> himself . _ &#93; Mark your divorce , young sir , Whom son I dare not call ; thou art too base To be <unk> : thou a sceptre ’ s heir , That thus affects a <unk> !
Thou , old traitor , I am sorry that , by hanging thee , I can But <unk> thy life one week .
And thou , fresh piece Of excellent witchcraft , whom of force must know The royal fool thou <unk> ’ st with , — SHEPHERD .
O , my heart !
POLIXENES .
I ’ ll have thy beauty scratch ’ d with <unk> and made More homely than thy state .
For thee , fond boy , If I may ever know thou dost but sigh That thou no more shalt see this <unk> ( as never I mean thou shalt ) , we ’ ll bar thee from succession ; Not hold thee of our blood , no , not our kin , Far than <unk> off .
Mark thou my words .
Follow us to the court .
Thou <unk> , for this time , Though full of our displeasure , yet we free thee From the dead blow of it .
And you , <unk> , Worthy enough a <unk> ; yea , him too That makes himself , but for our honour therein , <unk> thee .
If ever henceforth thou These <unk> <unk> to his entrance open , Or <unk> his body more with thy <unk> , I will devise a death as cruel for thee As thou art tender to ’ t .
&#91; _ Exit . _ &#93; PERDITA .
Even here undone .
I was not much afeard , for once or twice I was about to speak , and tell him plainly The selfsame sun that shines upon his court <unk> not his visage from our <unk> , but Looks on alike .
&#91; _ To Florizel . _ &#93; Will ’ t please you , sir , be gone ?
I told you what would come of this .
Beseech you , Of your own state take care .
This dream of mine — Being now awake , I ’ ll queen it no inch farther , But milk my ewes , and weep .
CAMILLO .
Why , how now , father !
Speak ere thou diest .
SHEPHERD .
I cannot speak , nor think , Nor dare to know that which I know .
O sir , You have undone a man of fourscore three , That thought to fill his grave in quiet ; yea , To die upon the bed my father died , To lie close by his honest bones ; but now Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me Where no priest <unk> in dust .
O cursed wretch , That knew ’ st this was the prince , and wouldst adventure To mingle faith with him !
<unk> , undone !
If I might die within this hour , I have liv ’ d To die when I desire .
&#91; _ Exit . _ &#93; FLORIZEL .
Why look you so upon me ?
I am but sorry , not afeard ; delay ’ d , But nothing <unk> ’ red : what I was , I am : More <unk> on for <unk> back ; not following My <unk> <unk> .
CAMILLO .
Gracious my lord , You know your father ’ s temper : at this time He will allow no speech ( which I do guess You do not purpose to him ) and as hardly Will he endure your sight as yet , I fear : Then , till the fury of his highness <unk> , Come not before him .
FLORIZEL .
I not purpose it .
I think Camillo ?
CAMILLO .
Even he , my lord .
PERDITA .
How often have I told you ’ twould be thus !
How often said my dignity would last But till ’ twere known !
FLORIZEL .
It cannot fail but by The <unk> of my faith ; and then Let nature crush the sides o ’ th ’ earth together And mar the <unk> within !
<unk> up thy looks .
From my succession wipe me , father ; I Am heir to my affection .
CAMILLO .
Be advis ’ d .
FLORIZEL .
I am , and by my fancy .
If my reason Will thereto be obedient , I have reason ; If not , my senses , better pleas ’ d with madness , Do bid it welcome .
CAMILLO .
This is desperate , sir .
FLORIZEL .
So call it : but it does <unk> my vow .
I needs must think it honesty .
Camillo , Not for Bohemia , nor the pomp that may Be <unk> <unk> ’ d ; for all the sun sees or The close earth <unk> , or the profound seas hides In unknown <unk> , will I break my oath To this my fair belov ’ d .
Therefore , I pray you , As you have ever been my father ’ s honour ’ d friend , When he shall miss me , — as , in faith , I mean not To see him any more , — cast your good counsels Upon his passion : let myself and fortune <unk> for the time to come .
This you may know , And so deliver , I am put to sea With her whom here I cannot hold on shore ; And , most <unk> to her need , I have A vessel <unk> fast by , but not prepar ’ d For this design .
What course I mean to hold Shall nothing benefit your knowledge , nor <unk> me the <unk> .
CAMILLO .
O my lord , I would your spirit were <unk> for advice , Or stronger for your need .
FLORIZEL .
Hark , Perdita .
&#91; _ Takes her aside . _ &#93; &#91; _ To Camillo . _ &#93; I ’ ll hear you by and by .
CAMILLO .
He ’ s <unk> , <unk> ’ d for flight .
Now were I happy if His going I could frame to serve my turn , Save him from danger , do him love and honour , <unk> the sight again of dear Sicilia And that unhappy king , my master , whom I so much <unk> to see .
FLORIZEL .
Now , good Camillo , I am so <unk> with curious business that I leave out ceremony .
CAMILLO .
Sir , I think You have heard of my poor services , i ’ th ’ love That I have borne your father ?
FLORIZEL .
Very nobly Have you deserv ’ d : it is my father ’ s music To speak your deeds , not little of his care To have them <unk> ’ d as thought on .
CAMILLO .
Well , my lord , If you may please to think I love the king , And , through him , what ’ s nearest to him , which is Your gracious self , embrace but my direction , If your more <unk> and settled project May suffer alteration .
On mine honour , I ’ ll point you where you shall have such <unk> As shall become your highness ; where you may <unk> your mistress ; from the whom , I see , There ’ s no <unk> to be made , but by , As heavens forfend , your ruin .
Marry her , And with my best endeavours in your absence Your <unk> father strive to <unk> And bring him up to liking .
FLORIZEL .
How , Camillo , May this , almost a miracle , be done ?
That I may call thee something more than man , And after that trust to thee .
CAMILLO .
Have you thought on A place whereto you ’ ll go ?
FLORIZEL .
Not any yet .
But as th ’ <unk> accident is guilty To what we wildly do , so we profess <unk> to be the slaves of chance , and flies Of every wind that blows .
CAMILLO .
Then list to me : This follows , if you will not change your purpose , But undergo this flight , make for Sicilia , And there present yourself and your fair princess , For so , I see , she must be , ’ fore Leontes : She shall be <unk> as it becomes The partner of your bed .
Methinks I see Leontes opening his free arms and weeping His <unk> forth ; <unk> thee , the son , <unk> , As ’ twere i ’ th ’ father ’ s person ; kisses the hands Of your fresh princess ; o ’ er and o ’ er <unk> him ’ Twixt his unkindness and his kindness .
Th ’ one He chides to hell , and bids the other grow <unk> than thought or time .
FLORIZEL .
Worthy Camillo , What colour for my visitation shall I Hold up before him ?
CAMILLO .
Sent by the king your father To greet him and to give him comforts .
Sir , The manner of your bearing towards him , with What you ( as from your father ) shall deliver , Things known betwixt us three , I ’ ll write you down , The which shall point you forth at every sitting What you must say ; that he shall not perceive But that you have your father ’ s bosom there And speak his very heart .
FLORIZEL .
I am bound to you : There is some sap in this .
CAMILLO .
A course more <unk> Than a wild <unk> of yourselves To <unk> ’ d waters , <unk> ’ d shores , most certain To miseries enough : no hope to help you , But as you shake off one to take another : Nothing so certain as your <unk> , who Do their best office if they can but stay you Where you ’ ll be loath to be .
Besides , you know <unk> ’ s the very bond of love , Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together <unk> <unk> .
PERDITA .
One of these is true : I think affliction may <unk> the cheek , But not take in the mind .
CAMILLO .
Yea , say you so ?
There shall not at your father ’ s house , these seven years Be born another such .
FLORIZEL .
My good Camillo , She is as forward of her breeding as She is i ’ th ’ rear our birth .
CAMILLO .
I cannot say ’ tis pity She lacks <unk> , for she seems a mistress To most that teach .
PERDITA .
Your pardon , sir ; for this I ’ ll blush you thanks .
FLORIZEL .
My prettiest Perdita !
But , O , the thorns we stand upon !
Camillo , <unk> of my father , now of me , The medicine of our house , how shall we do ?
We are not furnish ’ d like Bohemia ’ s son , Nor shall appear in Sicilia .
CAMILLO .
My lord , Fear none of this .
I think you know my fortunes Do all lie there : it shall be so my care To have you <unk> appointed as if The scene you play were mine .
For instance , sir , That you may know you shall not want , — one word .
&#91; _ They talk aside . _ &#93; Enter <unk> .
AUTOLYCUS .
Ha , ha !
what a fool <unk> is !
and Trust , his sworn brother , a very simple gentleman !
I have sold all my <unk> .
Not a counterfeit stone , not a <unk> , glass , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , ballad , knife , <unk> , glove , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to keep my pack from fasting .
They throng who should buy first , as if my <unk> had been <unk> and brought a <unk> to the <unk> : by which means I saw whose purse was best in picture ; and what I saw , to my good use I remembered .
My clown ( who wants but something to be a reasonable man ) grew so in love with the wenches ’ song that he would not stir his <unk> till he had both tune and words ; which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears : you might have <unk> a <unk> , it was senseless ; ’ twas nothing to <unk> a <unk> of a purse ; I would have <unk> keys off that hung in chains : no hearing , no feeling , but my sir ’ s song , and <unk> the nothing of it .
So that in this time of <unk> I picked and cut most of their <unk> purses ; and had not the old man come in with a <unk> against his daughter and the king ’ s son , and <unk> my <unk> from the chaff , I had not left a purse alive in the whole army .
Camillo , Florizel and Perdita come forward .
CAMILLO .
Nay , but my letters , by this means being there So soon as you <unk> , shall clear that doubt .
FLORIZEL .
And those that you ’ ll procure from king Leontes ?
CAMILLO .
Shall satisfy your father .
PERDITA .
Happy be you !
All that you speak shows fair .
CAMILLO .
&#91; _ Seeing <unk> . _ &#93; Who have we here ?
We ’ ll make an instrument of this ; omit Nothing may give us aid .
AUTOLYCUS .
&#91; _ Aside . _ &#93; If they have overheard me now , — why , hanging .
CAMILLO .
How now , good fellow !
why <unk> thou so ?
Fear not , man ; here ’ s no harm intended to thee .
AUTOLYCUS .
I am a poor fellow , sir .
CAMILLO .
Why , be so still ; here ’ s nobody will steal that from thee : yet , for the outside of thy poverty we must make an exchange ; therefore <unk> thee instantly , — thou must think there ’ s a necessity in ’ t — and change garments with this gentleman : though the <unk> on his side be the worst , yet hold thee , there ’ s some boot .
&#91; _ Giving money . _ &#93; AUTOLYCUS .
I am a poor fellow , sir : &#91; _ Aside . _ &#93; I know ye well enough .
CAMILLO .
Nay , prithee dispatch : the gentleman is half <unk> already .
AUTOLYCUS .
Are you in earnest , sir ?
&#91; _ Aside . _ &#93; I smell the trick on ’ t .
FLORIZEL .
Dispatch , I prithee .
AUTOLYCUS .
Indeed , I have had earnest ; but I cannot with conscience take it .
CAMILLO .
<unk> , <unk> .
&#91; _ Florizel and <unk> exchange garments . _ &#93; <unk> mistress , — let my prophecy Come home to you ! — you must retire yourself Into some <unk> .
Take your sweetheart ’ s hat And pluck it o ’ er your brows , <unk> your face , <unk> you ; and , as you can , <unk> The truth of your own seeming ; that you may ( For I do fear eyes over ) to <unk> Get <unk> .
PERDITA .
I see the play so lies That I must bear a part .
CAMILLO .
No remedy .
Have you done there ?
FLORIZEL .
Should I now meet my father , He would not call me son .
CAMILLO .
Nay , you shall have no hat .
&#91; _ Giving it to Perdita . _ &#93; Come , lady , come .
Farewell , my friend .
AUTOLYCUS .
Adieu , sir .
FLORIZEL .
O Perdita , what have we twain forgot ?
Pray you a word .
&#91; _ They converse apart . _ &#93; CAMILLO .
&#91; _ Aside . _ &#93; What I do next , shall be to tell the king Of this escape , and whither they are bound ; Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail To force him after : in whose company I shall <unk> Sicilia ; for whose sight I have a woman ’ s longing .
FLORIZEL .
Fortune speed us !
Thus we set on , Camillo , to the <unk> .
CAMILLO .
The swifter speed the better .
&#91; _ Exeunt Florizel , Perdita and Camillo . _ &#93; AUTOLYCUS .
I understand the business , I hear it .
To have an open ear , a quick eye , and a nimble hand , is necessary for a <unk> ; a good nose is <unk> also , to smell out work for the other senses .
I see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive .
What an exchange had this been without boot !
What a boot is here with this exchange !
Sure the gods do this year <unk> at us , and we may do anything <unk> .
The prince himself is about a piece of iniquity , stealing away from his father with his <unk> at his heels : if I thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king withal , I would not do ’ t : I hold it the more knavery to conceal it ; and therein am I constant to my profession .
Enter Clown and Shepherd .
Aside , aside ; here is more matter for a hot brain : every lane ’ s end , every shop , church , <unk> , hanging , yields a careful man work .
CLOWN .
See , see ; what a man you are now !
There is no other way but to tell the king she ’ s a <unk> , and none of your flesh and blood .
SHEPHERD .
Nay , but hear me .
CLOWN .
Nay , but hear me .
SHEPHERD .
Go to , then .
CLOWN .
She being none of your flesh and blood , your flesh and blood has not offended the king ; and so your flesh and blood is not to be punished by him .
Show those things you found about her , those secret things , all but what she has with her : this being done , let the law go whistle , I warrant you .
SHEPHERD .
I will tell the king all , every word , yea , and his son ’ s pranks too ; who , I may say , is no honest man neither to his father nor to me , to go about to make me the king ’ s <unk> .
CLOWN .
Indeed , <unk> was the farthest off you could have been to him , and then your blood had been the dearer by I know how much an <unk> .
AUTOLYCUS .
&#91; _ Aside . _ &#93; Very wisely , <unk> !
SHEPHERD .
Well , let us to the king : there is that in this <unk> will make him scratch his beard .
AUTOLYCUS .
&#91; _ Aside . _ &#93; I know not what impediment this complaint may be to the flight of my master .
CLOWN .
Pray heartily he be at ’ palace .
AUTOLYCUS .
&#91; _ Aside . _ &#93; Though I am not <unk> honest , I am so sometimes by chance .
Let me pocket up my <unk> ’ s <unk> .
&#91; _ Takes off his false beard . _ &#93; How now , <unk> !
whither are you bound ?
SHEPHERD .
To the palace , an it like your worship .
AUTOLYCUS .
Your affairs there , what , with whom , the condition of that <unk> , the place of your dwelling , your names , your ages , of what having , breeding , and anything that is <unk> to be known ?
discover !
CLOWN .
We are but plain fellows , sir .
AUTOLYCUS .
A lie ; you are rough and <unk> .
Let me have no lying .
It becomes none but <unk> , and they often give us soldiers the lie ; but we pay them for it with stamped coin , not <unk> steel ; therefore they do not give us the lie .
CLOWN .
Your worship had like to have given us one , if you had not taken yourself with the manner .
SHEPHERD .
Are you a courtier , an ’ t like you , sir ?
AUTOLYCUS .
Whether it like me or no , I am a courtier .
<unk> thou not the air of the court in these <unk> ?
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court ?
receives not thy nose <unk> from me ?
<unk> I not on thy baseness <unk> ?
Think ’ st thou , for that I <unk> , or <unk> from thee thy business , I am therefore no courtier ?
I am courtier _ <unk> _ , and one that will either push on or pluck back thy business there .
<unk> I command thee to open thy affair .
SHEPHERD .
My business , sir , is to the king .
AUTOLYCUS .
What advocate hast thou to him ?
SHEPHERD .
I know not , an ’ t like you .
CLOWN .
<unk> ’ s the <unk> for a <unk> .
Say you have none .
SHEPHERD .
None , sir ; I have no <unk> , cock nor <unk> .
AUTOLYCUS .
How bless ’ d are we that are not simple men !
Yet nature might have made me as these are , Therefore I will not disdain .
CLOWN .
This cannot be but a great courtier .
SHEPHERD .
His garments are rich , but he wears them not <unk> .
CLOWN .
He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical : a great man , I ’ ll warrant ; I know by the <unk> on ’ s teeth .
AUTOLYCUS .
The <unk> there ?
What ’ s i ’ th ’ <unk> ?
Wherefore that box ?
SHEPHERD .
Sir , there lies such secrets in this <unk> and box which none must know but the king ; and which he shall know within this hour , if I may come to th ’ speech of him .
AUTOLYCUS .
<unk> , thou hast lost thy labour .
SHEPHERD .
Why , sir ?
AUTOLYCUS .
The king is not at the palace ; he is gone aboard a new ship to purge melancholy and air himself : for , if thou beest capable of things serious , thou must know the king is full of grief .
SHEPHERD .
So ’ tis said , sir ; about his son , that should have married a shepherd ’ s daughter .
AUTOLYCUS .
If that shepherd be not in <unk> , let him fly .
The curses he shall have , the <unk> he shall feel , will break the back of man , the heart of monster .
CLOWN .
Think you so , sir ?
AUTOLYCUS .
Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter ; but those that are <unk> to him , though removed fifty times , shall all come under the hangman : which , though it be great pity , yet it is necessary .
An old <unk> rogue , a <unk> , to offer to have his daughter come into grace !
Some say he shall be <unk> ; but that death is too soft for him , say I.
Draw our throne into a <unk> !
All deaths are too few , the <unk> too easy .
CLOWN .
Has the old man e ’ er a son , sir , do you hear , an ’ t like you , sir ?
AUTOLYCUS .
He has a son , who shall be <unk> alive ; then ’ <unk> over with honey , set on the head of a <unk> ’ s nest ; then stand till he be three <unk> and a dram dead ; then recovered again with <unk> or some other hot <unk> ; then , raw as he is , and in the <unk> day <unk> <unk> , shall he be set against a <unk> wall , the sun looking with a <unk> eye upon him , where he is to behold him with flies blown to death .
But what talk we of these <unk> rascals , whose miseries are to be <unk> at , their offences being so capital ?
Tell me ( for you seem to be honest plain men ) what you have to the king .
Being something gently considered , I ’ ll bring you where he is aboard , tender your persons to his presence , whisper him in your <unk> ; and if it be in man besides the king to effect your suits , here is man shall do it .
CLOWN .
He seems to be of great authority : close with him , give him gold ; and though authority be a stubborn bear , yet he is oft led by the nose with gold : show the <unk> of your purse to the outside of his hand , and no more ado .
Remember : “ <unk> ’ d ” and “ <unk> alive ” .
SHEPHERD .
An ’ t please you , sir , to undertake the business for us , here is that gold I have .
I ’ ll make it as much more , and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you .
AUTOLYCUS .
After I have done what I promised ?
SHEPHERD .
Ay , sir .
AUTOLYCUS .
Well , give me the moiety .
Are you a party in this business ?
CLOWN .
In some sort , sir : but though my case be a pitiful one , I hope I shall not be <unk> out of it .
AUTOLYCUS .
O , that ’ s the case of the shepherd ’ s son .
Hang him , he ’ ll be made an example .
CLOWN .
Comfort , good comfort !
We must to the king and show our strange sights .
He must know ’ tis none of your daughter nor my sister ; we are gone else .
Sir , I will give you as much as this old man does when the business is performed , and remain , as he says , your pawn till it be brought you .
AUTOLYCUS .
I will trust you .
Walk before toward the <unk> ; go on the <unk> .
I will but look upon the hedge , and follow you .
CLOWN .
We are blessed in this man , as I may say , even blessed .
SHEPHERD .
Let ’ s before , as he bids us .
He was provided to do us good .
&#91; _ Exeunt Shepherd and Clown . _ &#93; AUTOLYCUS .
If I had a mind to be honest , I see Fortune would not suffer me : she drops <unk> in my mouth .
I am <unk> now with a double occasion : gold , and a means to do the prince my master good ; which who knows how that may turn back to my <unk> ?
I will bring these two <unk> , these blind ones , aboard him .
If he think it fit to shore them again and that the complaint they have to the king concerns him nothing , let him call me rogue for being so far <unk> ; for I am proof against that title and what shame else belongs to ’ t .
To him will I present them .
There may be matter in it .
&#91; _ Exit . _ &#93; ACT V SCENE I. Sicilia .
A Room in the palace of Leontes .
Enter Leontes , <unk> , <unk> , Paulina and others .
<unk> Sir , you have done enough , and have perform ’ d A <unk> sorrow : no fault could you make Which you have not redeem ’ d ; indeed , paid down More <unk> than done trespass : at the last , Do as the heavens have done , forget your evil ; With them , forgive yourself .
LEONTES .
Whilst I remember Her and her virtues , I cannot forget My <unk> in them ; and so still think of The wrong I did myself : which was so much That <unk> it hath made my kingdom , and <unk> ’ d the sweet ’ st companion that e ’ er man <unk> his hopes out of .
PAULINA .
True , too true , my lord .
If , one by one , you wedded all the world , Or from the all that are took something good , To make a perfect woman , she you kill ’ d Would be <unk> ’ d .
LEONTES .
I think so .
Kill ’ d !
She I kill ’ d !
I did so : but thou <unk> ’ st me <unk> , to say I did : it is as bitter Upon thy tongue as in my thought .
Now , good now , Say so but seldom .
<unk> Not at all , good lady .
You might have spoken a thousand things that would Have done the time more benefit and <unk> ’ d Your kindness better .
PAULINA .
You are one of those Would have him wed again .
<unk> .
If you would not so , You pity not the state , nor the remembrance Of his most sovereign name ; consider little What dangers , by his highness ’ fail of issue , May drop upon his kingdom , and devour <unk> <unk> .
What were more holy Than to rejoice the former queen is well ?
What <unk> than , for royalty ’ s repair , For present comfort , and for future good , To bless the bed of majesty again With a sweet fellow to ’ t ?
PAULINA .
There is none worthy , <unk> her that ’ s gone .
Besides , the gods Will have <unk> ’ d their secret purposes ; For has not the divine Apollo said , Is ’ t not the tenor of his oracle , That king Leontes shall not have an heir Till his lost child be found ?
Which that it shall , Is all as monstrous to our human reason As my Antigonus to break his grave And come again to me ; who , on my life , Did perish with the infant .
’ Tis your counsel My lord should to the heavens be contrary , <unk> against their wills .
&#91; _ To Leontes . _ &#93; <unk> not for issue ; The crown will find an heir .
Great Alexander Left his to th ’ worthiest ; so his <unk> Was like to be the best .
LEONTES .
Good Paulina , Who hast the memory of Hermione , I know , in honour , O that ever I Had <unk> ’ d me to thy counsel !
Then , even now , I might have look ’ d upon my queen ’ s full eyes , Have taken treasure from her lips , — PAULINA .
And left them More rich for what they yielded .
LEONTES .
Thou speak ’ st truth .
No more such wives ; therefore , no wife : one worse , And better us ’ d , would make her <unk> spirit Again possess her corpse , and on this stage , ( Where we offenders now appear ) <unk> , And begin “ Why to me ? ” PAULINA .
Had she such power , She had just cause .
LEONTES .
She had ; and would incense me To murder her I married .
PAULINA .
I should so .
Were I the ghost that walk ’ d , I ’ d bid you mark Her eye , and tell me for what dull part in ’ t You chose her : then I ’ d <unk> , that even your ears Should <unk> to hear me ; and the words that follow ’ d Should be “ Remember mine . ” LEONTES .
<unk> , stars , And all eyes else dead coals !
Fear thou no wife ; I ’ ll have no wife , Paulina .
PAULINA .
Will you swear Never to marry but by my free leave ?
LEONTES .
Never , Paulina ; so be bless ’ d my spirit !
PAULINA .
Then , good my lords , bear witness to his oath .
<unk> You tempt him <unk> .
PAULINA .
Unless another , As like Hermione as is her picture , <unk> his eye .
<unk> Good madam , — PAULINA .
I have done .
Yet , if my lord will marry , — if you will , sir , No remedy but you will , — give me the office To choose you a queen : she shall not be so young As was your former , but she shall be such As , walk ’ d your first queen ’ s ghost , it should take joy To see her in your arms .
LEONTES .
My true Paulina , We shall not marry till thou bid ’ st us .
PAULINA .
That Shall be when your first queen ’ s again in breath ; Never till then .
Enter a Servant .
SERVANT .
One that gives out himself Prince Florizel , Son of Polixenes , with his princess ( she The fairest I have yet beheld ) desires access To your high presence .
LEONTES .
What with him ?
he comes not Like to his father ’ s greatness : his approach , So out of circumstance and sudden , tells us ’ Tis not a visitation fram ’ d , but forc ’ d By need and accident .
What train ?
SERVANT .
But few , And those but mean .
LEONTES .
His princess , say you , with him ?
SERVANT .
Ay , the most <unk> piece of earth , I think , That e ’ er the sun <unk> bright on .
PAULINA .
O Hermione , As every present time doth boast itself Above a better gone , so must thy grave Give way to what ’ s seen now !
Sir , you yourself Have said and writ so , — but your writing now Is <unk> than that theme , — ‘ She had not been , Nor was not to be <unk> ’ d ’ ; thus your verse <unk> ’ d with her beauty once ; ’ tis shrewdly ebb ’ d , To say you have seen a better .
SERVANT .
Pardon , madam : The one I have almost forgot , — your pardon ; — The other , when she has obtain ’ d your eye , Will have your tongue too .
This is a creature , Would she begin a <unk> , might quench the zeal Of all <unk> else ; make <unk> Of who she but bid follow .
PAULINA .
How !
not women ?
SERVANT .
Women will love her that she is a woman More worth than any man ; men , that she is The rarest of all women .
LEONTES .
Go , <unk> ; Yourself , <unk> with your honour ’ d friends , Bring them to our <unk> .
&#91; _ Exeunt <unk> and others . _ &#93; Still , ’ tis strange He thus should steal upon us .
PAULINA .
Had our prince , <unk> of children , seen this hour , he had pair ’ d Well with this lord .
There was not full a month Between their <unk> .
LEONTES .
Prithee no more ; cease ; Thou know ’ st He dies to me again when talk ’ d of : sure , When I shall see this gentleman , thy speeches Will bring me to consider that which may <unk> me of reason .
They are come .
Enter Florizel , Perdita , <unk> and others .
Your mother was most true to wedlock , prince ; For she did print your royal father off , <unk> you .
Were I but <unk> , Your father ’ s image is so hit in you , His very air , that I should call you brother , As I did him , and speak of something wildly By us perform ’ d before .
Most dearly welcome !
And your fair princess , — goddess !
O , alas !
I lost a couple that ’ twixt heaven and earth Might thus have stood , <unk> wonder , as You , gracious couple , do !
And then I lost , — All mine own folly , — the society , <unk> too , of your brave father , whom , Though bearing misery , I desire my life Once more to look on him .
FLORIZEL .
By his command Have I here touch ’ d Sicilia , and from him Give you all greetings that a king , at friend , Can send his brother : and , but infirmity , Which waits upon worn times , hath something <unk> ’ d His wish ’ d ability , he had himself The lands and waters ’ twixt your throne and his <unk> ’ d , to look upon you ; whom he loves , He bade me say so , — more than all the <unk> And those that bear them living .
LEONTES .
O my brother , — Good gentleman ! — the wrongs I have done thee stir <unk> within me ; and these thy offices , So rarely kind , are as <unk> Of my <unk> <unk> !
Welcome hither , As is the spring to the earth .
And hath he too <unk> ’ d this paragon to the fearful usage , At least ungentle , of the dreadful Neptune , To greet a man not worth her pains , much less Th ’ adventure of her person ?
FLORIZEL .
Good , my lord , She came from <unk> .
LEONTES .
Where the warlike <unk> , That noble honour ’ d lord , is fear ’ d and lov ’ d ?
FLORIZEL .
Most royal sir , from thence ; from him , whose daughter His tears proclaim ’ d his , parting with her : thence , A prosperous <unk> friendly , we have cross ’ d , To execute the charge my father gave me For <unk> your highness : my best train I have from your <unk> shores dismiss ’ d ; Who for Bohemia bend , to signify Not only my success in <unk> , sir , But my <unk> , and my wife ’ s , in safety Here , where we are .
LEONTES .
The blessed gods <unk> all infection from our air whilst you Do <unk> here !
You have a holy father , A <unk> gentleman ; against whose person , So sacred as it is , I have done sin , For which the heavens , taking angry note , Have left me <unk> .
And your father ’ s bless ’ d , As he from heaven merits it , with you , Worthy his goodness .
What might I have been , Might I a son and daughter now have look ’ d on , Such goodly things as you !
Enter a Lord .
LORD .
Most noble sir , That which I shall report will bear no credit , Were not the proof so nigh .
Please you , great sir , Bohemia greets you from himself by me ; Desires you to attach his son , who has — His dignity and duty both cast off — <unk> from his father , from his hopes , and with A shepherd ’ s daughter .
LEONTES .
Where ’ s Bohemia ?
speak .
LORD .
Here in your city ; I now came from him .
I speak <unk> , and it becomes My marvel and my message .
To your court Whiles he was hast ’ ning — in the chase , it seems , Of this fair couple — meets he on the way The father of this seeming lady and Her brother , having both their country <unk> With this young prince .
FLORIZEL .
Camillo has betray ’ d me ; Whose honour and whose honesty till now , <unk> ’ d all <unk> .
LORD .
Lay ’ t so to his charge .
He ’ s with the king your father .
LEONTES .
Who ?
Camillo ?
LORD .
Camillo , sir ; I spake with him ; who now Has these poor men in question .
Never saw I <unk> so quake : they kneel , they kiss the earth ; <unk> themselves as often as they speak .
Bohemia stops his ears , and <unk> them With divers deaths in death .
PERDITA .
O my poor father !
The heaven sets spies upon us , will not have Our contract <unk> .
LEONTES .
You are married ?
FLORIZEL .
We are not , sir , nor are we like to be .
The stars , I see , will kiss the <unk> first .
The odds for high and low ’ s alike .
LEONTES .
My lord , Is this the daughter of a king ?
FLORIZEL .
She is , When once she is my wife .
LEONTES .
That “ once ” , I see by your good father ’ s speed , Will come on very <unk> .
I am sorry , Most sorry , you have broken from his liking , Where you were tied in duty ; and as sorry Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty , That you might well enjoy her .
FLORIZEL .
Dear , look up : Though Fortune , <unk> an enemy , Should chase us with my father , power no jot Hath she to change our loves .
Beseech you , sir , Remember since you ow ’ d no more to time Than I do now : with thought of such affections , <unk> forth mine advocate .
At your request My father will grant precious things as trifles .
LEONTES .
Would he do so , I ’ d beg your precious mistress , Which he <unk> but a trifle .
PAULINA .
Sir , my liege , Your eye hath too much youth in ’ t : not a month ’ Fore your queen died , she was more worth such <unk> Than what you look on now .
LEONTES .
I thought of her Even in these looks I made .
&#91; _ To Florizel . _ &#93; But your petition Is yet <unk> ’ d .
I will to your father .
Your honour not o ’ <unk> by your desires , I am friend to them and you : upon which errand I now go toward him ; therefore follow me , And mark what way I make .
Come , good my lord .
&#91; _ Exeunt . _ &#93; SCENE II .
The same .
Before the Palace .
Enter <unk> and a Gentleman .
AUTOLYCUS .
Beseech you , sir , were you present at this relation ?
FIRST GENTLEMAN .
I was by at the opening of the <unk> , heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it : whereupon , after a little <unk> , we were all commanded out of the chamber ; only this , methought I heard the shepherd say he found the child .
AUTOLYCUS .
I would most gladly know the issue of it .
FIRST GENTLEMAN .
I make a broken <unk> of the business ; but the changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were very notes of admiration .
They seemed almost , with <unk> on one another , to tear the cases of their eyes .
There was speech in their <unk> , language in their very <unk> ; they looked as they had heard of a world <unk> , or one <unk> .
A notable passion of wonder appeared in them ; but the wisest <unk> , that knew no more but seeing could not say if th ’ <unk> were joy or sorrow ; but in the extremity of the one , it must needs be .
Here comes a gentleman that happily knows more .
Enter a Gentleman .
The news , <unk> ?
SECOND GENTLEMAN .
Nothing but <unk> : the oracle is <unk> : the king ’ s daughter is found : such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that <unk> cannot be able to express it .
Here comes the Lady Paulina ’ s steward : he can deliver you more .
Enter a third Gentleman .
How goes it now , sir ?
This news , which is called true , is so like an old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion .
Has the king found his heir ?
THIRD GENTLEMAN .
Most true , if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance .
That which you hear you ’ ll swear you see , there is such <unk> in the proofs .
The mantle of Queen Hermione ’ s , her jewel about the neck of it , the letters of Antigonus found with it , which they know to be his character ; the majesty of the creature in <unk> of the mother , the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding , and many other <unk> proclaim her with all <unk> to be the king ’ s daughter .
Did you see the meeting of the two kings ?
SECOND GENTLEMAN .
No .
THIRD GENTLEMAN .
Then you have lost a sight which was to be seen , cannot be spoken of .
There might you have beheld one joy crown another , so and in such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them , for their joy <unk> in tears .
There was <unk> up of eyes , holding up of hands , with countenance of such distraction that they were to be known by garment , not by favour .
Our king , being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter , as if that joy were now become a loss , cries “ O , thy mother , thy mother ! ” then <unk> Bohemia <unk> ; then <unk> his son-in-law ; then again <unk> he his daughter with <unk> her ; now he thanks the old shepherd , which stands by like a <unk> <unk> of many kings ’ reigns .
I never heard of such another encounter , which <unk> report to follow it , and <unk> description to do it .
SECOND GENTLEMAN .
What , pray you , became of Antigonus , that carried hence the child ?
THIRD GENTLEMAN .
Like an old tale still , which will have matter to rehearse , though credit be asleep and not an ear open .
He was torn to pieces with a bear : this <unk> the shepherd ’ s son , who has not only his innocence , which seems much , to justify him , but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows .
FIRST GENTLEMAN .
What became of his bark and his followers ?
THIRD GENTLEMAN .
<unk> the same instant of their master ’ s death , and in the view of the shepherd : so that all the instruments which <unk> to <unk> the child were even then lost when it was found .
But O , the noble combat that ’ twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina !
She had one eye <unk> for the loss of her husband , another <unk> that the oracle was <unk> .
She <unk> the princess from the earth , and so locks her in <unk> , as if she would pin her to her heart , that she might no more be in danger of losing .
FIRST GENTLEMAN .
The dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes ; for by such was it <unk> .
THIRD GENTLEMAN .
One of the prettiest touches of all , and that which <unk> for mine eyes ( caught the water , though not the fish ) was , when at the relation of the queen ’ s death ( with the manner how she came to it bravely confessed and <unk> by the king ) how <unk> wounded his daughter ; till , from one sign of <unk> to another , she did , with an “ Alas , ” I would fain say , bleed tears , for I am sure my heart wept blood .
Who was most marble there changed colour ; some <unk> , all <unk> : if all the world could have seen it , the woe had been universal .
FIRST GENTLEMAN .
Are they returned to the court ?
THIRD GENTLEMAN .
No : the princess hearing of her mother ’ s statue , which is in the keeping of Paulina , — a piece many years in doing and now newly performed by that rare Italian master , <unk> <unk> , who , had he himself eternity , and could put breath into his work , would beguile Nature of her custom , so <unk> he is her ape : he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer .
Thither with all <unk> of affection are they gone , and there they intend to sup .
SECOND GENTLEMAN .
I thought she had some great matter there in hand ; for she hath <unk> twice or thrice a day , ever since the death of Hermione , visited that removed house .
Shall we thither , and with our company piece the <unk> ?
FIRST GENTLEMAN .
Who would be thence that has the benefit of access ?
Every wink of an eye some new grace will be born .
Our absence makes us <unk> to our knowledge .
Let ’ s along .
&#91; _ Exeunt Gentlemen . _ &#93; AUTOLYCUS .
Now , had I not the dash of my former life in me , would preferment drop on my head .
I brought the old man and his son aboard the prince ; told him I heard them talk of a <unk> and I know not what .
But he at that time <unk> of the shepherd ’ s daughter ( so he then took her to be ) , who began to be much <unk> , and himself little better , extremity of weather <unk> , this mystery <unk> <unk> ’ d .
But ’ tis all one to me ; for had I been the <unk> of this secret , it would not have relish ’ d among my other <unk> .
Enter Shepherd and Clown .
Here come those I have done good to against my will , and already <unk> in the <unk> of their fortune .
SHEPHERD .
Come , boy ; I am past more children , but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born .
CLOWN .
You are well met , sir .
You denied to fight with me this other day , because I was no gentleman born .
See you these clothes ?
Say you see them not and think me still no gentleman born : you were best say these robes are not gentlemen born .
Give me the lie , do ; and try whether I am not now a gentleman born .
AUTOLYCUS .
I know you are now , sir , a gentleman born .
CLOWN .
Ay , and have been so any time these four hours .
SHEPHERD .
And so have I , boy !
CLOWN .
So you have : but I was a gentleman born before my father ; for the king ’ s son took me by the hand and called me brother ; and then the two kings called my father brother ; and then the prince , my brother , and the princess , my sister , called my father father ; and so we wept ; and there was the first <unk> tears that ever we shed .
SHEPHERD .
We may live , son , to shed many more .
CLOWN .
Ay ; or else ’ twere hard luck , being in so <unk> estate as we are .
AUTOLYCUS .
I humbly beseech you , sir , to pardon me all the faults I have committed to your worship , and to give me your good report to the prince my master .
SHEPHERD .
Prithee , son , do ; for we must be gentle , now we are gentlemen .
CLOWN .
Thou wilt amend thy life ?
AUTOLYCUS .
Ay , an it like your good worship .
CLOWN .
Give me thy hand : I will swear to the prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia .
SHEPHERD .
You may say it , but not swear it .
CLOWN .
Not swear it , now I am a gentleman ?
Let <unk> and <unk> say it , I ’ ll swear it .
SHEPHERD .
How if it be false , son ?
CLOWN .
If it be ne ’ er so false , a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend .
And I ’ ll swear to the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk ; but I know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk : but I ’ ll swear it ; and I would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands .
AUTOLYCUS .
I will prove so , sir , to my power .
CLOWN .
Ay , by any means , prove a tall fellow : if I do not wonder how thou dar ’ st venture to be drunk , not being a tall fellow , trust me not .
Hark !
the kings and the princes , our kindred , are going to see the queen ’ s picture .
Come , follow us : we ’ ll be thy good masters .
&#91; _ Exeunt . _ &#93; SCENE III .
The same .
A Room in Paulina ’ s house .
Enter Leontes , Polixenes , Florizel , Perdita , Camillo , Paulina , Lords and Attendants .
LEONTES .
O grave and good Paulina , the great comfort That I have had of thee !
PAULINA .
What , sovereign sir , I did not well , I meant well .
All my services You have paid home : but that you have <unk> ’ d , With your crown ’ d brother and these your contracted <unk> of your kingdoms , my poor house to visit , It is a <unk> of your grace which never My life may last to answer .
LEONTES .
O Paulina , We honour you with trouble .
But we came To see the statue of our queen : your <unk> Have we pass ’ d through , not without much content In many <unk> ; but we saw not That which my daughter came to look upon , The statue of her mother .
PAULINA .
As she liv ’ d <unk> , So her dead likeness , I do well believe , <unk> <unk> yet you look ’ d upon Or hand of man hath done ; therefore I keep it <unk> , apart .
But here it is : prepare To see the life as lively mock ’ d as ever Still sleep mock ’ d death .
Behold , and say ’ tis well .
Paulina <unk> a curtain , and <unk> Hermione standing as a statue .
I like your silence , it the more shows off Your wonder : but yet speak .
First you , my liege .
Comes it not something near ?
LEONTES .
Her natural <unk> !
<unk> me , dear stone , that I may say indeed Thou art Hermione ; or rather , thou art she In thy not chiding ; for she was as tender As infancy and grace .
But yet , Paulina , Hermione was not so much wrinkled , nothing So aged as this seems .
POLIXENES .
O , not by much !
PAULINA .
So much the more our <unk> ’ s excellence , Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her As she liv ’ d now .
LEONTES .
As now she might have done , So much to my good comfort as it is Now piercing to my soul .
O , thus she stood , Even with such life of majesty , warm life , As now it coldly stands , when first I woo ’ d her !
I am asham ’ d : does not the stone rebuke me For being more stone than it ?
O royal piece , There ’ s magic in thy majesty , which has My evils <unk> ’ d to remembrance and From thy <unk> daughter took the spirits , <unk> like stone with thee .
PERDITA .
And give me leave , And do not say ’ tis <unk> , that I kneel , and then <unk> her blessing .
Lady , Dear queen , that ended when I but began , Give me that hand of yours to kiss .
PAULINA .
O , patience !
The statue is but newly fix ’ d , the colour ’ s Not dry .
CAMILLO .
My lord , your sorrow was too sore laid on , Which sixteen winters cannot blow away , So many <unk> dry .
<unk> any joy Did ever so long live ; no sorrow But kill ’ d itself much sooner .
POLIXENES .
Dear my brother , Let him that was the cause of this have power To take off so much grief from you as he Will piece up in himself .
PAULINA .
Indeed , my lord , If I had thought the sight of my poor image Would thus have wrought you — for the stone is mine — I ’ d not have show ’ d it .
LEONTES .
Do not draw the curtain .
PAULINA .
No longer shall you gaze on ’ t , lest your fancy May think anon it moves .
LEONTES .
Let be , let be .
Would I were dead , but that methinks already — What was he that did make it ?
See , my lord , Would you not deem it breath ’ d ?
And that those veins Did <unk> bear blood ?
POLIXENES .
<unk> done : The very life seems warm upon her lip .
LEONTES .
The <unk> of her eye has motion in ’ t , As we are mock ’ d with art .
PAULINA .
I ’ ll draw the curtain : My lord ’ s almost so far transported that He ’ ll think anon it lives .
LEONTES .
O sweet Paulina , Make me to think so twenty years together !
No settled senses of the world can match The pleasure of that madness .
Let ’ t alone .
PAULINA .
I am sorry , sir , I have thus far <unk> ’ d you : but I could afflict you further .
LEONTES .
Do , Paulina ; For this affliction has a taste as sweet As any cordial comfort .
Still methinks There is an air comes from her .
What fine <unk> Could ever yet cut breath ?
Let no man mock me , For I will kiss her !
PAULINA .
Good my lord , forbear : The <unk> upon her lip is wet ; You ’ ll mar it if you kiss it , stain your own With <unk> painting .
Shall I draw the curtain ?
LEONTES .
No , not these twenty years .
PERDITA .
So long could I Stand by , a <unk> on .
PAULINA .
Either forbear , <unk> presently the chapel , or resolve you For more amazement .
If you can behold it , I ’ ll make the statue move indeed , descend , And take you by the hand .
But then you ’ ll think ( Which I protest against ) I am <unk> By wicked powers .
LEONTES .
What you can make her do I am content to look on : what to speak , I am content to hear ; for ’ tis as easy To make her speak as move .
PAULINA .
It is <unk> ’ d You do awake your faith .
Then all stand still ; Or those that think it is unlawful business I am about , let them depart .
LEONTES .
Proceed : No foot shall stir .
PAULINA .
Music , awake her : strike !
&#91; _ Music . _ &#93; ’ Tis time ; descend ; be stone no more ; approach ; Strike all that look upon with marvel .
Come ; I ’ ll fill your grave up : stir ; nay , come away .
<unk> to death your <unk> , for from him Dear life <unk> you .
You perceive she stirs .
Hermione comes down from the <unk> .
<unk> not ; her actions shall be holy as You hear my spell is lawful .
Do not shun her Until you see her die again ; for then You kill her double .
Nay , present your hand : When she was young you woo ’ d her ; now in age Is she become the suitor ?
LEONTES .
&#91; _ <unk> her . _ &#93; O , she ’ s warm !
If this be magic , let it be an art <unk> as <unk> .
POLIXENES .
She <unk> him .
CAMILLO .
She hangs about his neck .
If she <unk> to life , let her speak too .
POLIXENES .
Ay , and make it manifest where she has liv ’ d , Or how stol ’ n from the dead .
PAULINA .
That she is living , Were it but told you , should be <unk> at Like an old tale ; but it appears she lives , Though yet she speak not .
Mark a little while .
Please you to <unk> , fair madam .
Kneel And pray your mother ’ s blessing .
Turn , good lady , Our Perdita is found .
&#91; _ <unk> Perdita who kneels to Hermione . _ &#93; HERMIONE .
You gods , look down , And from your sacred <unk> pour your graces Upon my daughter ’ s head !
Tell me , mine own , Where hast thou been <unk> ’ d ?
where liv ’ d ?
how found Thy father ’ s court ?
for thou shalt hear that I , Knowing by Paulina that the oracle Gave hope thou wast in being , have <unk> ’ d Myself to see the issue .
PAULINA .
There ’ s time enough for that ; Lest they desire upon this push to trouble Your joys with like relation .
Go together , You precious <unk> all ; your <unk> <unk> to everyone .
I , an old <unk> , Will wing me to some wither ’ d <unk> , and there My mate , that ’ s never to be found again , <unk> till I am lost .
LEONTES .
O peace , Paulina !
Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent , As I by thine a wife : this is a match , And made between ’ s by vows .
Thou hast found mine ; But how , is to be question ’ d ; for I saw her , As I thought , dead ; and have in vain said many A prayer upon her grave .
I ’ ll not seek far — For him , I partly know his mind — to find thee An honourable husband .
Come , Camillo , And take her by the hand , whose worth and honesty Is richly noted , and here <unk> By us , a pair of kings .
Let ’ s from this place .
What !
look upon my brother : both your <unk> , That e ’ er I put between your holy looks My ill suspicion .
This your son-in-law , And son unto the king , whom heavens <unk> , Is <unk> to your daughter .
Good Paulina , Lead us from hence ; where we may <unk> Each one demand , and answer to his part <unk> ’ d in this wide gap of time , since first We were <unk> ’ d .
<unk> lead away !
&#91; _ Exeunt . _ &#93; A <unk> ’ S <unk> From off a hill whose <unk> womb <unk> A <unk> story from a <unk> ’ ring vale , My spirits t ’ attend this double voice <unk> , And down I laid to list the <unk> ’ d tale ; Ere long <unk> a fickle maid full pale , <unk> of papers , breaking rings <unk> , <unk> her world with sorrow ’ s wind and rain .
Upon her head a <unk> <unk> of straw , Which <unk> her visage from the sun , Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw The <unk> of a beauty spent and done ; Time had not <unk> all that youth begun , Nor youth all quit , but spite of heaven ’ s fell rage Some beauty <unk> through <unk> of <unk> ’ d age .
Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne , Which on it had <unk> characters , <unk> ’ ring the silken figures in the brine That <unk> woe had <unk> in tears , And often reading what contents it bears ; As often <unk> <unk> ’ d woe , In clamours of all size , both high and low .
Sometimes her <unk> ’ d eyes their carriage ride , As they did <unk> ’ ry to the spheres intend ; Sometime <unk> their poor balls are tied To th ’ <unk> earth ; sometimes they do extend Their view right on ; anon their <unk> lend To every place at once , and <unk> fix ’ d , The mind and sight <unk> <unk> ’ d .
Her hair , nor loose nor tied in formal <unk> , Proclaim ’ d in her a careless hand of pride ; For some <unk> ’ d descended her <unk> ’ d hat , <unk> her pale and <unk> cheek beside ; Some in her <unk> <unk> still did bide , And , true to bondage , would not break from thence , Though <unk> <unk> in loose negligence .
A thousand favours from a <unk> she drew , Of <unk> , crystal , and of <unk> <unk> , Which one by one she in a river threw , Upon whose weeping <unk> she was set , Like <unk> <unk> wet to wet , Or <unk> ’ hands , that lets not bounty fall Where want cries ‘ some , ’ but where excess <unk> ‘ all ’ .
Of <unk> <unk> had she many a one , Which she <unk> ’ d , sigh ’ d , <unk> and gave the flood ; <unk> ’ d many a ring of <unk> gold and bone , <unk> them find their <unk> in mud ; Found yet <unk> letters sadly <unk> ’ d in blood , With <unk> silk , feat and <unk> <unk> ’ d , and seal ’ d to curious secrecy .
These often bath ’ d she in her <unk> eyes , And often kiss ’ d , and often gave to tear ; Cried , ‘ O false blood , thou <unk> of lies , What <unk> witness dost thou bear !
<unk> would have seem ’ d more black and damned here ! ’ This said , in top of rage the lines she <unk> , <unk> discontent so breaking their contents .
A reverend man that <unk> his <unk> nigh , Sometime a <unk> , that the <unk> knew Of court , of city , and had let go by The <unk> hours <unk> as they <unk> , Towards this <unk> fancy <unk> drew ; And , <unk> ’ d by age , desires to know In brief the grounds and <unk> of her woe .
So <unk> he down upon his <unk> <unk> , And <unk> <unk> sits he by her side , When he again desires her , being sat , Her <unk> with his hearing to divide : If that from him there may be aught <unk> Which may her suffering ecstasy <unk> , ’ Tis promised in the charity of age .
‘ Father , ’ she says , ‘ though in me you behold The injury of many a <unk> hour , Let it not tell your judgement I am old , Not age , but sorrow , over me hath power .
I might as yet have been a <unk> flower , <unk> to myself , if I had <unk> Love to myself , and to no love beside .
‘ But woe is me !
Too early I attended A youthful suit ; it was to gain my grace ; O one by nature ’ s <unk> so commended , That maiden ’ s eyes stuck over all his face , Love lack ’ d a dwelling and made him her place ; And when in his fair parts she did abide , She was new lodg ’ d and newly <unk> .
‘ His <unk> locks did hang in crooked <unk> , And every light occasion of the wind Upon his lips their silken parcels <unk> , What ’ s sweet to do , to do will <unk> find , Each eye that saw him did <unk> the mind : For on his visage was in little drawn , What <unk> thinks in paradise was <unk> .
‘ Small show of man was yet upon his chin ; His phoenix down began but to appear , Like <unk> velvet , on that <unk> skin , Whose bare <unk> ’ d the web it seemed to wear .
Yet show ’ d his visage by that cost more dear , And nice affections <unk> stood in doubt If best were as it was , or best without .
‘ His qualities were beauteous as his form , For <unk> he was , and thereof free ; Yet if men mov ’ d him , was he such a storm As oft ’ twixt May and April is to see , When winds breathe sweet , unruly though they be .
His <unk> so with his <unk> ’ d youth Did livery <unk> in a pride of truth .
‘ Well could he ride , and often men would say That horse his mettle from his rider takes , Proud of <unk> , noble by the sway , What <unk> , what bounds , what course , what stop he makes !
And controversy hence a question takes , Whether the horse by him became his deed , Or he his manage by th ’ <unk> steed .
‘ But quickly on this side the <unk> went , His <unk> <unk> gave life and grace To <unk> and to ornament , <unk> ’ d in himself , not in his case ; All <unk> , themselves made fairer by their place , Came for <unk> ; yet their purpos ’ d trim <unk> ’ d not his grace , but were all <unk> ’ d by him .
‘ So on the <unk> of his <unk> tongue All kind of arguments and question deep , All <unk> prompt , and reason strong , For his advantage still did wake and sleep , To make the <unk> laugh , the <unk> weep : He had the <unk> and different skill , <unk> all passions in his craft of will .
‘ That he did in the general bosom reign Of young , of old , and <unk> both <unk> , To dwell with him in thoughts , or to remain In personal duty , following where he <unk> , <unk> ’ s <unk> ’ d , ere he desire , have granted , And <unk> for him what he would say , Ask ’ d their own wills , and made their wills obey .
‘ Many there were that did his picture get To serve their eyes , and in it put their mind , Like fools that in th ’ imagination set The goodly objects which abroad they find Of lands and <unk> , theirs in thought <unk> ’ d , And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them , Than the true <unk> <unk> which doth owe them .
‘ So many have , that never touch ’ d his hand , <unk> <unk> ’ d them mistress of his heart .
My woeful self that did in freedom stand , And was my own <unk> ( not in part ) What with his art in youth , and youth in art , <unk> my affections in his <unk> power , <unk> ’ d the <unk> and gave him all my flower .
‘ Yet did I not , as some my <unk> did , <unk> of him , nor being desired yielded , Finding myself in honour so forbid , With <unk> distance I mine honour <unk> .
<unk> for me many <unk> <unk> Of proofs <unk> , which remain ’ d the foil Of this false jewel , and his amorous spoil .
‘ But ah !
Who ever <unk> ’ d by precedent The <unk> ’ d ill she must herself assay , Or force ’ d <unk> ’ gainst her own content , To put the <unk> ’ d <unk> in her way ?
<unk> may stop a while what will not stay : For when we rage , advice is often seen By <unk> us to make our wills more keen .
‘ Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood , That we must curb it upon others ’ proof , To be <unk> the sweets that seems so good , For fear of harms that <unk> in our <unk> .
O appetite , from judgement stand aloof !
The one a palate hath that needs will taste , Though reason weep and cry , “ It is thy last . ” ‘ For further I could say , “ This man ’ s <unk> ” , And knew the <unk> of his foul <unk> ; Heard where his plants in others ’ <unk> grew , Saw how <unk> were gilded in his smiling ; <unk> vows were ever <unk> to <unk> ; <unk> characters and words merely but art , And bastards of his foul <unk> heart .
‘ And long upon these terms I held my city , Till thus he ’ <unk> besiege me : “ Gentle maid , Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity , And be not of my holy vows afraid : That ’ s to ye sworn , to none was ever said , For feasts of love I have been call ’ d unto , Till now did ne ’ er invite , nor never woo .
‘ “ All my offences that abroad you see Are errors of the blood , none of the mind : Love made them not ; with <unk> they may be , Where neither party is nor true nor kind , They sought their shame that so their shame did find , And so much less of shame in me remains , By how much of me their reproach contains .
‘ “ Among the many that mine eyes have seen , Not one whose flame my heart so much as <unk> , Or my affection put to th ’ smallest <unk> , Or any of my <unk> ever <unk> : <unk> have I done to them , but ne ’ er was <unk> ; <unk> hearts in <unk> , but mine own was free , And reign ’ d commanding in his <unk> .
‘ “ Look here what <unk> wounded fancies sent me , Of <unk> pearls and <unk> red as blood , <unk> that they their passions likewise lent me Of grief and blushes , <unk> understood In <unk> white and the <unk> ’ d mood ; <unk> of terror and dear modesty , <unk> ’ d in hearts , but fighting <unk> .
‘ “ And , lo !
behold these talents of their hair , With <unk> metal <unk> <unk> ’ d , I have receiv ’ d from many a several fair , Their kind acceptance <unk> beseech ’ d , With th ’ <unk> of fair <unk> enrich ’ d , And <unk> ’ d <unk> that did <unk> Each stone ’ s dear nature , worth and quality .
‘ “ The diamond , why ’ twas beautiful and hard , Whereto his <unk> ’ d <unk> did tend , The deep green <unk> , in whose fresh regard <unk> sights their sickly <unk> do amend ; The <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> With objects <unk> ; each several stone , With wit well blazon ’ d <unk> ’ d , or made some moan .
‘ “ Lo , all these <unk> of affections hot , Of <unk> ’ d and subdued desires the tender , Nature hath charg ’ d me that I <unk> them not , But yield them up where I myself must render , That is , to you , my <unk> and <unk> : For these of force must your <unk> be , Since I their altar , you <unk> me .
‘ “ O then advance of yours that <unk> hand , Whose white <unk> down the airy scale of praise ; Take all these <unk> to your own command , <unk> with sighs that burning lungs did raise : What me , your minister for you , <unk> , <unk> under you ; and to your audit comes Their distract parcels in <unk> sums .
‘ “ Lo , this device was sent me from a <unk> , Or sister <unk> of <unk> note , Which late her noble suit in court did shun , Whose rarest <unk> made the <unk> dote ; For she was sought by spirits of <unk> coat , But kept cold distance , and did thence remove To spend her living in eternal love .
‘ “ But O , my sweet , what labour is ’ t to leave The thing we have not , mast ’ ring what not strives , <unk> the place which did no form receive , <unk> patient sports in <unk> <unk> , She that her fame so to herself <unk> , The scars of battle ’ <unk> by the flight , And makes her absence valiant , not her might .
‘ “ O pardon me , in that my boast is true , The accident which brought me to her eye , Upon the moment did her force <unk> , And now she would the <unk> <unk> fly : <unk> love put out religion ’ s eye : Not to be tempted would she be <unk> ’ d , And now to tempt all , liberty <unk> ’ d .
‘ “ How mighty then you are , O hear me tell !
The broken bosoms that to me belong Have <unk> all their <unk> in my well , And mine I pour your ocean all among : I strong o ’ er them , and you o ’ er me being strong , Must for your victory us all <unk> , As compound love to physic your cold breast .
‘ “ My parts had pow ’ r to charm a sacred <unk> , Who , <unk> ’ d and <unk> in grace , <unk> ’ d her eyes when they t ’ <unk> begun , All vows and <unk> giving place .
O most <unk> love !
<unk> , bond , nor space , In thee hath neither sting , knot , nor confine , For thou art all and all things else are thine .
‘ “ When thou <unk> , what are precepts worth Of stale example ?
When thou wilt <unk> , How coldly those <unk> stand forth , Of wealth , of <unk> fear , law , kindred , fame !
Love ’ s arms are peace , ’ gainst rule , ’ gainst sense , ’ gainst shame , And <unk> , in the suff ’ ring pangs it bears , The <unk> of all forces , <unk> and fears .
‘ “ Now all these hearts that do on mine depend , <unk> it break , with bleeding groans they pine , And <unk> their sighs to your extend , To leave the <unk> ’ ry that you make ’ gainst mine , <unk> soft audience to my sweet design , And <unk> soul to that <unk> oath , That shall prefer and undertake my troth . ” ‘ This said , his wat ’ ry eyes he did <unk> , Whose sights till then were <unk> ’ d on my face ; Each cheek a river running from a <unk> With <unk> current <unk> <unk> apace .
O how the channel to the stream gave grace !
Who , <unk> ’ d with crystal gate the <unk> roses That flame through water which their hue <unk> .
‘ O father , what a hell of witchcraft lies In the small orb of one particular tear !
But with the <unk> of the eyes What <unk> heart to water will not wear ?
What breast so cold that is not <unk> here ?
O <unk> effect !
Cold modesty , hot wrath , Both fire from hence and <unk> <unk> hath .
‘ For lo , his passion , but an art of craft , Even there resolv ’ d my reason into tears ; There my white stole of chastity I <unk> ’ d , <unk> off my sober <unk> , and civil fears , Appear to him as he to me appears , All melting , though our drops this <unk> ’ <unk> bore : His poison ’ d me , and mine did him restore .
‘ In him a <unk> of subtle matter , <unk> to <unk> , all strange forms receives , Of burning blushes , or of weeping water , Or <unk> <unk> ; and he takes and leaves , In either ’ s <unk> , as it best <unk> , To blush at speeches rank , to weep at woes , Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows .
‘ That not a heart which in his level came Could ’ scape the hail of his <unk> aim , Showing fair nature is both kind and tame ; And veil ’ d in them , did win whom he would <unk> .
Against the thing he sought he would exclaim ; When he most <unk> in <unk> ’ d <unk> , He <unk> ’ d pure maid , and prais ’ d cold chastity .
‘ Thus merely with the garment of a grace , The naked and concealed fiend he cover ’ d , That th ’ <unk> gave the <unk> place , Which , like a <unk> , above them <unk> ’ d .
Who , young and simple , would not be so lover ’ d ?
Ay me !
I fell , and yet do question make What I should do again for such a sake .
‘ O , that infected <unk> of his eye , O , that false fire which in his cheek so <unk> ’ d !
O , that forc ’ d thunder from his heart did fly , O , that sad breath his <unk> lungs bestow ’ d , O , all that borrowed motion , seeming <unk> , Would yet again betray the <unk> , And new <unk> a <unk> maid . ’ THE <unk> <unk> I When my love swears that she is made of truth , I do believe her , though I know she lies , That she might think me some <unk> ’ d youth , <unk> in the world ’ s false <unk> .
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young , Although I know my years be past the best , I smiling credit her <unk> tongue , <unk> faults in love with love ’ s ill rest .
But wherefore says my love that she is young ?
And wherefore say not I that I am old ?
O , love ’ s best habit is a <unk> tongue , And age , in love , loves not to have years told .
Therefore , I ’ ll lie with love , and love with me , Since that our faults in love thus smother ’ d be .
II Two loves I have , of comfort and despair , That like two spirits do <unk> me still ; My better angel is a man right fair , My worser spirit a woman colour ’ d ill . To win me soon to hell , my female evil <unk> my better angel from my side , And would corrupt my saint to be a devil , <unk> his purity with her fair pride .
And whether that my angel be turn ’ d fiend , <unk> I may , yet not directly tell ; For being both to me , both to each friend , I guess one angel in another ’ s hell : The truth I shall not know , but live in doubt , Till my bad angel fire my good one out .
III Did not the heavenly <unk> of thine eye , ’ Gainst whom the world could not hold argument , <unk> my heart to this false perjury ?
<unk> for thee broke deserve not punishment .
A woman I forswore ; but I will prove , Thou being a goddess , I forswore not thee : My vow was earthly , thou a heavenly love ; Thy grace being gain ’ d cures all disgrace in me .
My vow was breath , and breath a vapour is ; Then , thou fair sun , that on this earth doth shine , <unk> this vapour vow ; in thee it is ; If broken then , it is no fault of mine .
If by me broke , what fool is not so wise To break an oath , to win a paradise ?
IV Sweet <unk> , sitting by a brook With young Adonis , lovely , fresh and green , Did court the lad with many a lovely look , Such looks as none could look but beauty ’ s queen .
She told him stories to delight his ear ; She show ’ d him favours to <unk> his eye ; To win his heart , she touch ’ d him here and there ; <unk> so soft still conquer chastity .
But whether <unk> years did want conceit , Or he <unk> ’ d to take her <unk> ’ d proffer , The tender <unk> would not touch the bait , But smile and jest at every gentle offer .
Then fell she on her back , fair queen , and toward : He rose and ran away ; ah , fool too froward !
V If love make me forsworn , how shall I swear to love ?
O never faith could hold , if not to beauty vowed .
Though to myself forsworn , to thee I ’ ll constant prove ; Those thoughts , to me like <unk> , to thee like <unk> bowed .
<unk> his bias leaves , and makes his book thine eyes , Where all those pleasures live that art can <unk> .
If knowledge be the mark , to know thee shall suffice ; Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend , All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder ; Which is to me some praise , that I thy parts admire .
Thine eye Jove ’ s lightning seems , thy voice his dreadful thunder , Which , not to anger bent , is music and sweet fire .
<unk> as thou art , O do not love that wrong , To sing heaven ’ s praise with such an earthly tongue .
VI <unk> had the sun dried up the <unk> morn , And scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade , When <unk> , all in love forlorn , A longing <unk> for Adonis made Under an <unk> growing by a brook , A brook where <unk> used to cool his spleen .
<unk> was the day ; she <unk> that did look For his approach , that often there had been .
Anon he comes , and throws his mantle by , And stood stark naked on the brook ’ s green <unk> : The sun look ’ d on the world with glorious eye , Yet not so <unk> as this queen on him .
He , <unk> her , <unk> ’ d in , <unk> he stood , “ O Jove , ” quoth she , “ why was not I a flood ? ” VII Fair is my love , but not so fair as fickle , <unk> as a dove , but neither true nor trusty , <unk> than glass , and yet , as glass is , <unk> , <unk> than wax , and yet , as iron , rusty : A lily pale , with <unk> <unk> to grace her , None fairer , nor none <unk> to <unk> her .
Her lips to mine how often hath she joined , Between each kiss her oaths of true love swearing !
How many tales to please me hath she <unk> , <unk> my love , the loss thereof still fearing !
Yet in the midst of all her pure <unk> , Her faith , her oaths , her tears , and all were <unk> .
She burnt with love , as straw with fire <unk> ; She burnt out love , as soon as straw <unk> ; She fram ’ d the love , and yet she foil ’ d the <unk> ; She bade love last , and yet she fell <unk> .
Was this a lover , or a <unk> whether ?
<unk> in the best , though excellent in neither .
VIII If music and sweet poetry agree , As they must needs , the sister and the brother , Then must the love be great ’ twixt thee and me , Because thou lov ’ st the one and I the other .
<unk> to thee is dear , whose heavenly touch Upon the lute doth ravish human sense ; <unk> to me , whose deep conceit is such As passing all conceit , needs no defence .
Thou lov ’ st to hear the sweet <unk> sound That Phœbus ’ lute , the queen of music , makes ; And I in deep delight am chiefly drown ’ d <unk> himself to singing he <unk> .
One god is god of both , as <unk> feign ; One knight loves both , and both in thee remain .
IX Fair was the morn when the fair queen of love , * * * * * * <unk> for sorrow than her <unk> dove , For <unk> ’ s sake , a <unk> proud and wild ; Her stand she takes upon a <unk> hill ; Anon Adonis comes with horn and hounds ; She , silly queen , with more than love ’ s good will , <unk> the boy he should not pass those grounds .
“ Once , ” quoth she , “ did I see a fair sweet youth Here in these <unk> <unk> with a boar , Deep in the thigh , a spectacle of <unk> !
See in my thigh , ” quoth she , “ here was the sore . ” She showed hers : he saw more wounds than one , And blushing fled , and left her all alone .
<unk> Sweet rose , fair flower , untimely pluck ’ d , soon <unk> , Pluck ’ d in the bud and <unk> in the spring !
<unk> <unk> pearl , alack , too <unk> <unk> !
Fair creature , kill ’ d too soon by death ’ s sharp sting !
Like a green <unk> that hangs upon a tree , And falls , through wind , before the fall should be .
I weep for thee , and yet no cause I have ; For why thou left ’ st me nothing in thy will ; And yet thou left ’ st me more than I did crave ; For why I <unk> nothing of thee still .
O yes , dear friend , I pardon crave of thee , Thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me .
<unk> Venus , with young Adonis sitting by her Under a <unk> shade , began to woo him ; She told the <unk> how god Mars did try her , And as he fell to her , she fell to him .
“ Even thus , ” quoth she , “ the warlike god <unk> ’ d me , ” And then she <unk> ’ d Adonis in her arms ; “ Even thus , ” quoth she , “ the warlike god <unk> me ; ” As if the boy should use like loving charms ; “ Even thus , ” quoth she , “ he seized on my lips , ” And with her lips on his did act the <unk> ; And as she <unk> breath , away he <unk> , And would not take her meaning nor her pleasure .
Ah , that I had my lady at this bay , To kiss and clip me till I run away !
<unk> <unk> age and youth cannot live together : Youth is full of <unk> , age is full of care ; Youth like summer morn , age like winter weather ; Youth like summer brave , age like winter bare .
Youth is full of sport , age ’ s breath is short ; Youth is nimble , age is lame ; Youth is hot and bold , age is weak and cold ; Youth is wild , and age is tame .
<unk> , I do abhor thee ; youth , I do adore thee ; O , my love , my love is young !
<unk> , I do defy thee .
O , sweet shepherd , hie thee , For methinks thou stay ’ st too long .
<unk> Beauty is but a vain and doubtful good , A shining gloss that <unk> suddenly ; A flower that dies when first it ’ gins to bud ; A <unk> glass that ’ s broken presently : A doubtful good , a gloss , a glass , a flower , <unk> , <unk> , broken , dead within an hour .
And as goods lost are <unk> or never found , As <unk> gloss no <unk> will <unk> , As flowers dead lie wither ’ d on the ground , As broken glass no <unk> can redress , So beauty blemish ’ d once , for ever ’ s lost , In spite of physic , painting , pain and cost .
<unk> Good night , good rest .
Ah , neither be my share : She bade good night that kept my rest away ; And <unk> ’ d me to a cabin hang ’ d with care , To <unk> on the doubts of my decay .
“ Farewell , ” quoth she , “ and come again tomorrow : ” Fare well I could not , for I <unk> ’ d with sorrow .
Yet at my parting sweetly did she smile , In scorn or friendship , <unk> I <unk> whether : ’ T may be , she joy ’ d to jest at my exile , ’ T may be , again to make me wander thither : “ <unk> , ” a word for shadows like myself , As take the pain , but cannot pluck the <unk> .
Lord , how mine eyes throw <unk> to the east !
My heart doth charge the watch ; the morning rise Doth <unk> each moving sense from idle rest .
Not daring trust the office of mine eyes , While <unk> sits and sings , I sit and mark , And wish her lays were <unk> like the lark .
For she doth welcome daylight with her <unk> , And drives away dark dreaming night .
The night so pack ’ d , I post unto my pretty ; Heart hath his hope and eyes their wished sight ; Sorrow chang ’ d to solace , solace <unk> ’ d with sorrow ; For why , she sigh ’ d , and bade me come tomorrow .
Were I with her , the night would post too soon ; But now are minutes added to the hours ; To spite me now , each minute seems a moon ; Yet not for me , shine sun to succour flowers !
<unk> night , peep day ; good day , of night now borrow : <unk> , night , tonight , and length thyself tomorrow .
<unk> It was a <unk> ’ s daughter , the fairest one of three , That <unk> of her master as well as well might be , Till looking on an Englishman , the fairest that eye could see , Her fancy fell <unk> .
Long was the combat doubtful , that love with love did fight , To leave the master <unk> , or kill the gallant knight ; To put in practice either , alas , it was a spite Unto the silly <unk> !
But one must be <unk> ; more <unk> was the pain , That nothing could be used to turn them both to gain , For of the two the trusty knight was wounded with disdain : Alas she could not help it !
Thus art with arms <unk> was victor of the day , Which by a gift of learning did bear the maid away : Then <unk> , the learned man hath got the lady gay ; For now my song is ended .
<unk> On a day , alack the day !
Love , whose month was ever May , <unk> a blossom passing fair , <unk> in the wanton air .
Through the velvet leaves the wind All unseen ’ <unk> passage find , That the lover , sick to death , <unk> ’ d himself the heaven ’ s breath : “ <unk> , ” quoth he , “ thy cheeks may blow ; <unk> , would I might triumph so !
But , alas , my hand hath sworn Ne ’ er to pluck thee from thy thorn : <unk> , alack , for youth <unk> , Youth , so apt to pluck a sweet !
Thou for whom Jove would swear Juno but an <unk> were , And deny himself for Jove , Turning mortal for thy love . ” <unk> My <unk> feed not , my ewes breed not , My <unk> speed not , all is <unk> : Love is dying , faith ’ s <unk> , Heart ’ s <unk> , <unk> of this .
All my merry <unk> are quite forgot , All my lady ’ s love is lost , God wot : Where her faith was <unk> fix ’ d in love , There a nay is <unk> ’ d without remove .
One silly cross wrought all my loss ; O frowning fortune , cursed fickle dame !
For now I see <unk> More in women than in men remain .
In black mourn I , all fears scorn I , Love hath forlorn me , living in thrall .
Heart is bleeding , all help <unk> , O cruel <unk> , <unk> with gall .
My shepherd ’ s pipe can sound no deal .
My weather ’ s bell rings <unk> knell ; My <unk> dog that wont to have play ’ d , <unk> not at all , but seems afraid .
With sighs so deep <unk> to weep , In howling wise , to see my <unk> plight .
How sighs <unk> through <unk> ground , Like a thousand <unk> ’ d men in bloody fight !
<unk> <unk> spring not , sweet birds sing not , Green plants bring not forth their <unk> ; <unk> stands weeping , <unk> all sleeping , <unk> black <unk> fearfully .
All our pleasure known to us poor <unk> , All our merry <unk> on the plains , All our evening sport from us is fled , All our love is lost , for love is dead .
<unk> , sweet love , thy like ne ’ er was For a sweet content , the cause of all my woe !
Poor <unk> must live alone ; Other help for him I see that there is none .
<unk> <unk> thine eye hath chose the dame , And <unk> ’ d the deer that thou shouldst strike , Let reason rule things worthy blame , As well as fancy , <unk> might ; Take counsel of some wiser head , Neither too young nor yet <unk> .
And when thou com ’ st thy tale to tell , <unk> not thy tongue with <unk> talk , <unk> she some subtle practice smell , — A <unk> soon can find a halt , — But plainly say thou lov ’ st her well , And set her person forth to sale .
What though her frowning brows be bent , Her cloudy looks will calm ere night , And then too late she will repent , That thus <unk> her delight ; And twice desire , ere it be day , That which with scorn she put away .
What though she strive to try her strength , And <unk> and brawl , and say thee nay , Her feeble force will yield at length , When craft hath taught her thus to say : “ Had women been so strong as men , In faith , you had not had it then . ” And to her will frame all thy ways ; Spare not to spend , and chiefly there Where thy desert may merit praise , By <unk> in thy lady ’ s ear : The strongest castle , tower and town , The golden <unk> beats it down .
<unk> always with assured trust , And in thy suit be humble true ; Unless thy lady prove unjust , <unk> never thou to choose a new : When time shall serve , be thou not slack , To proffer , though she put thee back .
The <unk> and <unk> that women work , <unk> with an outward show , The tricks and toys that in them <unk> , The cock that treads them shall not know , Have you not heard it said full oft , A woman ’ s nay doth stand for nought .
Think women still to strive with men , To sin and never for to saint : There is no heaven , by holy then , When time with age shall them attaint , Were kisses all the joys in bed , One woman would another wed .
But soft , enough , — too much , — I fear Lest that my mistress hear my song : She will not stick to round me on th ’ ear , To teach my tongue to be so long .
Yet will she blush , here be it said , To hear her secrets so <unk> ’ d .
<unk> Live with me and be my love , And we will all the pleasures prove That hills and <unk> , <unk> and fields , And all the <unk> mountains yield .
There will we sit upon the rocks , And see the shepherds feed their <unk> , By shallow rivers , by whose falls <unk> birds sing <unk> .
There will I make thee a bed of roses , With a thousand <unk> <unk> , A cap of flowers , and a <unk> <unk> all with leaves of <unk> .
A <unk> of straw and <unk> buds , With <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> ; And if these pleasures may thee move , Then live with me and be my love .
Love ’ s Answer .
If that the world and love were young , And truth in every shepherd ’ s tongue , These pretty pleasures might me move To live with thee and be thy love .
<unk> As it fell upon a day In the merry month of May , <unk> in a pleasant shade Which a grove of <unk> made , <unk> did leap and birds did sing , <unk> did grow and plants did spring ; <unk> did banish moan , Save the nightingale alone : She , poor bird , as all forlorn , <unk> ’ d her breast <unk> a thorn , And there sung the <unk> ’ st <unk> , That to hear it was great <unk> .
“ Fie , fie , fie , ” now would she cry , “ <unk> , <unk> , ” by and by ; That to hear her so complain , <unk> I could from tears <unk> , For her griefs so lively shown Made me think upon mine own .
Ah , thought I , thou mourn ’ st in vain !
None takes <unk> on thy pain .
<unk> trees they cannot hear thee , <unk> bears they will not cheer thee ; King <unk> he is dead , All thy friends are <unk> ’ d in lead , All thy fellow birds do sing , <unk> of thy <unk> .
Whilst as fickle fortune <unk> , Thou and I were both beguiled .
Every one that <unk> thee Is no friend in misery .
Words are easy , like the wind ; <unk> friends are hard to find .
Every man will be thy friend Whilst thou hast <unk> to spend ; But if store of crowns be <unk> , No man will supply thy want .
If that one be prodigal , <unk> they will him call , And with <unk> flattering , “ Pity but he were a king . ” If he be <unk> to vice , Quickly him they will <unk> ; If to women he be bent , They have at <unk> .
But if Fortune once do frown , Then farewell his great renown .
They that fawn ’ d on him before , Use his company no more .
He that is thy friend indeed , He will help thee in thy need : If thou sorrow , he will weep ; If thou wake , he cannot sleep .
Thus of every grief in heart He with thee doth bear a part .
These are certain signs to know <unk> friend from <unk> ’ ring foe .
THE <unk> AND THE <unk> Let the bird of <unk> lay , On the sole <unk> tree , Herald sad and trumpet be , To whose sound chaste wings obey .
But thou <unk> <unk> , Foul <unk> of the fiend , <unk> of the fever ’ s end , To this troop come thou not near .
From this <unk> <unk> Every fowl of tyrant wing , Save the eagle , feather ’ d king ; Keep the <unk> so strict .
Let the priest in <unk> white , That <unk> music can , Be the <unk> swan , Lest the <unk> lack his right .
And thou <unk> crow , That thy <unk> <unk> mak ’ st With the breath thou <unk> ’ st and tak ’ st , ’ <unk> our <unk> shalt thou go .
Here the <unk> doth <unk> : Love and constancy is dead ; <unk> and the <unk> fled In a mutual flame from hence .
So they lov ’ d , as love in twain Had the <unk> but in one ; Two <unk> , division none : <unk> there in love was slain .
<unk> remote , yet not asunder ; <unk> and no space was seen ’ Twixt this <unk> and his queen ; But in them it were a wonder .
So between them love did shine , That the <unk> saw his right <unk> in the phoenix ’ sight ; Either was the other ’ s mine .
<unk> was thus <unk> , That the self was not the same ; <unk> nature ’ s double name Neither two nor one was called .
<unk> , in itself confounded , Saw division grow together ; To themselves yet either neither , Simple were so well compounded .
That it cried , How true a twain <unk> this <unk> one !
Love hath reason , reason none , If what parts can so remain .
<unk> it made this <unk> To the phoenix and the dove , <unk> and stars of love , As <unk> to their tragic scene .
<unk> Beauty , truth , and <unk> .
Grace in all simplicity , Here <unk> ’ d in <unk> lie .
Death is now the phoenix ’ nest ; And the <unk> ’ s loyal breast To eternity doth rest .
Leaving no posterity : — ’ Twas not their infirmity , It was married chastity .
Truth may seem , but cannot be ; Beauty brag , but ’ tis not she ; Truth and beauty buried be .
To this <unk> let those repair That are either true or fair ; For these dead birds sigh a prayer .
THE <unk> OF <unk> <unk> THE <unk> <unk> HENRY <unk> , EARL OF <unk> , and <unk> of <unk> .
The love I dedicate to your <unk> is without end ; whereof this <unk> , without beginning , is but a superfluous moiety .
The warrant I have of your honourable disposition , not the worth of my <unk> lines , makes it assured of acceptance .
What I have done is yours ; what I have to do is yours ; being part in all I have , <unk> yours .
Were my worth greater , my duty would show greater ; meantime , as it is , it is bound to your <unk> , to whom I wish long life , still <unk> with all happiness .
Your <unk> ’ s in all duty , WILLIAM <unk> .
THE <unk> .
Lucius <unk> ( for his <unk> pride <unk> <unk> ) , after he had caused his own <unk> , <unk> <unk> , to be <unk> murdered , and , contrary to the Roman laws and <unk> , not <unk> or <unk> for the people ’ s <unk> , had possessed himself of the kingdom , went , accompanied with his sons and other <unk> of Rome , to besiege <unk> .
During which siege the principal men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of <unk> <unk> , the king ’ s son , in their <unk> after supper , everyone commended the virtues of his own wife ; among whom <unk> <unk> the <unk> chastity of his wife <unk> .
In that pleasant humour they all posted to Rome ; and <unk> , by their secret and sudden <unk> , to make trial of that which everyone had before <unk> , only <unk> finds his wife , though it were late in the night , <unk> amongst her maids : the other ladies were all found dancing and <unk> , or in several <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> yielded <unk> the victory , and his wife the fame .
At that time <unk> <unk> being <unk> with Lucrece ’ s beauty , yet <unk> his passions for the present , <unk> with the rest back to the camp ; from whence he shortly after <unk> <unk> himself , and was ( according to his estate ) <unk> entertained and <unk> by Lucrece at <unk> .
The same night he <unk> <unk> into her chamber , <unk> ravished her , and early in the morning <unk> away .
Lucrece , in this lamentable plight , <unk> dispatched messengers , one to Rome for her father , another to the camp for Collatine .
They came , the one accompanied with <unk> Brutus , the other with Publius <unk> ; and finding Lucrece <unk> in mourning habit , demanded the cause of her sorrow .
She , first taking an oath of them for her revenge , <unk> the actor , and whole manner of his dealing , and withal suddenly stabbed herself .
Which done , with one consent they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the <unk> ; and bearing the dead body to Rome , Brutus acquainted the people with the <unk> and manner of the vile deed , with a bitter <unk> against the tyranny of the king ; <unk> the people were so moved , that with one consent and a general <unk> the <unk> were all <unk> , and the state government changed from kings to <unk> .
From the <unk> <unk> all in post , <unk> by the <unk> wings of false desire , <unk> Tarquin leaves the Roman host , And to <unk> bears the <unk> fire , Which in pale <unk> hid , <unk> to <unk> And girdle with <unk> flames the waist Of Collatine ’ s fair love , Lucrece the chaste .
Haply that name of “ chaste ” <unk> ’ <unk> set This <unk> edge on his keen appetite , When Collatine <unk> did not let To praise the clear <unk> red and white Which <unk> in that sky of his delight ; Where mortal stars as bright as heaven ’ s beauties , With pure <unk> did him <unk> duties .
For he the night before , in Tarquin ’ s tent <unk> the treasure of his happy state , What <unk> wealth the heavens had him lent In the possession of his beauteous mate ; <unk> ’ ning his fortune at such high proud rate That kings might be <unk> to more fame , But king nor peer to such a <unk> dame .
O happiness <unk> but of a few , And , if possessed , as soon <unk> and done As is the morning ’ s silver melting dew Against the golden <unk> of the sun !
An <unk> date , <unk> ere well begun .
Honour and beauty in the owner ’ s arms , Are <unk> <unk> from a world of harms .
Beauty itself doth of itself persuade The eyes of men without an orator ; What <unk> then <unk> be made , To set forth that which is so <unk> ?
Or why is Collatine the <unk> Of that rich jewel he should keep unknown From <unk> ears , because it is his own ?
Perchance his boast of Lucrece ’ <unk> ’ <unk> <unk> this proud issue of a king ; For by our ears our hearts oft tainted be .
Perchance that envy of so rich a thing , <unk> compare , <unk> did sting His <unk> thoughts , that meaner men should <unk> That golden hap which their <unk> want .
But some untimely thought did <unk> His <unk> speed , if none of those ; His honour , his affairs , his friends , his state , <unk> all , with swift intent he goes To quench the coal which in his liver <unk> .
O rash false heat , <unk> in <unk> cold , Thy hasty spring still blasts and ne ’ er grows old !
When at <unk> this false lord arrived , Well was he <unk> by the Roman dame , Within whose face beauty and virtue <unk> Which of them both should <unk> her fame .
When virtue <unk> , beauty would blush for shame ; When beauty <unk> blushes , in despite Virtue would stain that o ’ er with silver white .
But beauty , in that white <unk> From Venus ’ doves , doth challenge that fair field .
Then virtue claims from beauty beauty ’ s red , Which virtue gave the golden age to gild Their silver cheeks , and called it then their shield ; <unk> them thus to use it in the fight , When shame <unk> , the red should fence the white .
This <unk> in Lucrece ’ face was seen , <unk> by beauty ’ s red and virtue ’ s white .
Of either ’ s colour was the other queen , <unk> from world ’ s <unk> their right .
Yet their ambition makes them still to fight ; The sovereignty of either being so great , That oft they <unk> each other ’ s seat .
Their silent war of <unk> and of roses , Which Tarquin <unk> in her fair face ’ s field , In their pure ranks his traitor eye <unk> ; Where , lest between them both it should be killed , The coward captive vanquished doth yield To those two armies that would let him go Rather than triumph in so false a foe .
Now thinks he that her husband ’ s shallow tongue , The niggard prodigal that praised her so , In that high task hath done her beauty wrong , Which far exceeds his barren skill to show .
Therefore that praise which Collatine doth owe <unk> Tarquin answers with <unk> , In silent wonder of <unk> eyes .
This earthly saint , <unk> by this devil , Little <unk> the false <unk> ; For <unk> thoughts do seldom dream on evil ; <unk> never <unk> no secret <unk> fear .
So guiltless she <unk> gives good cheer And reverend welcome to her princely guest , Whose inward ill no outward harm expressed .
For that he <unk> with his high estate , <unk> base sin in <unk> of majesty , That nothing in him seemed <unk> , Save sometime too much wonder of his eye , Which , having all , all could not satisfy ; But , <unk> rich , so <unk> in his store That , <unk> with much , he <unk> still for more .
But she , that never <unk> with stranger eyes , Could pick no meaning from their <unk> looks , Nor read the subtle shining <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of such books ; She touched no unknown <unk> , nor feared no <unk> , Nor could she <unk> his wanton sight , More than his eyes were <unk> to the light .
He stories to her ears her husband ’ s fame , <unk> in the fields of fruitful Italy ; And <unk> with praises Collatine ’ s high name , Made glorious by his manly chivalry With <unk> arms and <unk> of victory .
Her joy with <unk> hand she doth express , And , <unk> , so greets heaven for his success .
Far from the purpose of his coming thither , He makes <unk> for his being there .
No cloudy show of <unk> <unk> ’ ring weather Doth yet in his fair welkin once appear , Till <unk> <unk> , mother of dread and fear , Upon the world dim darkness doth <unk> , And in her <unk> prison <unk> the day .
For then is Tarquin brought unto his bed , <unk> <unk> with heavy <unk> ; For after supper long he <unk> With modest Lucrece , and wore out the night .
Now leaden slumber with life ’ s strength doth fight , And every one to rest themselves <unk> , Save thieves and cares and troubled minds that wake .
As one of which doth Tarquin lie <unk> The <unk> dangers of his will ’ s <unk> , Yet ever to obtain his will <unk> , Though <unk> hopes persuade him to <unk> .
Despair to gain doth traffic oft for <unk> , And when great treasure is the meed <unk> , Though death be <unk> , there ’ s no death supposed .
Those that much <unk> are with gain so fond For what they have not , that which they possess They scatter and <unk> it from their bond ; And so , by <unk> more , they have but less , Or , <unk> more , the profit of excess Is but to surfeit , and such griefs sustain , That they prove <unk> in this <unk> gain .
The aim of all is but to nurse the life With honour , wealth , and ease , in <unk> age ; And in this aim there is such <unk> strife That one for all or all for one we gage : As life for honour in fell battle ’ s rage , Honour for wealth ; and oft that wealth doth cost The death of all , and all together lost .
So that in vent ’ ring ill we leave to be The things we are , for that which we expect ; And this ambitious foul infirmity , In having much , torments us with defect Of that we have .
So then we do neglect The thing we have , and , all for want of wit , Make something nothing by <unk> it .
Such hazard now must doting Tarquin make , <unk> his honour to obtain his lust ; And for himself himself he must forsake .
Then where is truth , if there be no <unk> ?
When shall he think to find a stranger just , When he himself himself confounds , <unk> To <unk> ’ rous tongues and wretched hateful days ?
Now stole upon the time the dead of night , When heavy sleep had <unk> up mortal eyes .
No comfortable star did lend his light , No noise but <unk> ’ and wolves ’ <unk> cries ; Now serves the season that they may surprise The silly lambs .
<unk> thoughts are dead and still , While lust and murder wake to stain and kill .
And now this <unk> lord <unk> from his bed , <unk> his mantle <unk> o ’ er his arm ; Is madly <unk> between desire and dread ; Th ’ one sweetly <unk> , th ’ other <unk> harm .
But honest fear , <unk> with lust ’ s foul charm , Doth too too oft <unk> him to retire , <unk> away by <unk> rude desire .
His <unk> on a flint he softly <unk> , That from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly ; Whereat a waxen torch forthwith he <unk> , Which must be <unk> to his <unk> eye , And to the flame thus speaks <unk> : “ As from this cold flint I enforced this fire , So Lucrece must I force to my desire . ” Here pale with fear he doth <unk> The dangers of his loathsome enterprise , And in his inward mind he doth debate What following sorrow may on this arise .
Then looking <unk> , he doth despise His naked armour of <unk> lust , And justly thus <unk> his thoughts unjust : “ Fair torch , burn out thy light , and lend it not To <unk> her whose light <unk> thine .
And die , <unk> thoughts , before you blot With your <unk> that which is divine .
<unk> pure incense to so pure a <unk> .
Let fair humanity abhor the deed That spots and <unk> love ’ s modest <unk> weed .
“ O shame to knighthood and to shining arms !
O foul dishonour to my household ’ s grave !
O <unk> act including all foul harms !
A martial man to be soft fancy ’ s slave !
True valour still a true respect should have .
Then my <unk> is so vile , so base , That it will live <unk> in my face .
“ Yea , though I die , the scandal will survive And be an <unk> in my golden coat ; Some loathsome dash the herald will contrive , To <unk> me how fondly I did dote , That my posterity , shamed with the note , Shall curse my bones , and hold it for no sin To wish that I their father had not been .
“ What win I if I gain the thing I seek ?
A dream , a breath , a <unk> of <unk> joy .
Who buys a minute ’ s mirth to wail a week , Or <unk> eternity to get a toy ?
For one sweet <unk> who will the vine destroy ?
Or what fond beggar , but to touch the crown , Would with the sceptre straight be <unk> down ?
“ If <unk> dream of my intent , Will he not wake , and in a <unk> ’ rate rage Post hither , this vile purpose to prevent ? — This siege that hath <unk> his marriage , This <unk> to youth , this sorrow to the <unk> , This dying virtue , this <unk> shame , Whose crime will bear an <unk> blame ?
“ O , what excuse can my invention make When thou shalt charge me with so black a deed ?
Will not my tongue be mute , my frail joints shake , Mine eyes <unk> their light , my false heart bleed ?
The guilt being great , the fear doth still exceed ; And extreme fear can neither fight nor fly , But <unk> with trembling terror die .
“ Had <unk> killed my son or sire , Or <unk> in ambush to betray my life , Or were he not my dear friend , this desire Might have excuse to work upon his wife , As in revenge or <unk> of such strife ; But as he is my kinsman , my dear friend , The shame and fault finds no excuse nor end .
“ <unk> it is ; ay , if the fact be known .
<unk> it is , there is no hate in loving .
I ’ ll beg her love .
But she is not her own .
The worst is but denial and <unk> .
My will is strong , past reason ’ s weak <unk> .
Who fears a sentence or an old man ’ s saw Shall by a painted cloth be kept in awe . ” Thus , <unk> , holds he <unk> ’ <unk> frozen conscience and <unk> will , And with good thoughts makes <unk> , <unk> the worser sense for vantage still ; Which in a moment doth confound and kill All pure effects , and doth so far proceed That what is vile shows like a virtuous deed .
<unk> he , “ She took me kindly by the hand , And <unk> for tidings in my eager eyes , <unk> some hard news from the warlike band Where her beloved <unk> lies .
O how her fear did make her colour rise !
First red as roses that on <unk> we lay , Then white as <unk> , the roses took away .
“ And how her hand , in my hand being locked , <unk> it to tremble with her loyal fear , Which struck her sad , and then it faster <unk> , Until her husband ’ s <unk> she did hear ; Whereat she <unk> with so sweet a cheer That had <unk> seen her as she stood , <unk> had never drowned him in the flood .
“ Why hunt I then for colour or <unk> ?
All <unk> are dumb when beauty <unk> .
Poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses ; Love <unk> not in the heart that shadows <unk> .
<unk> is my captain , and he <unk> ; And when his gaudy <unk> is <unk> , The coward fights and will not be <unk> .
“ Then , childish fear , <unk> !
<unk> , die !
<unk> and reason wait on wrinkled age !
My heart shall never <unk> mine eye .
Sad pause and deep regard <unk> the <unk> ; My part is youth , and beats these from the stage .
Desire my pilot is , beauty my prize ; Then who fears <unk> where such treasure lies ? ” As corn o ’ <unk> by weeds , so <unk> fear Is almost <unk> by <unk> lust .
Away he steals with opening , list ’ ning ear , Full of foul hope , and full of fond mistrust ; Both which , as <unk> to the unjust , So cross him with their opposite persuasion That now he vows a league , and now <unk> .
Within his thought her heavenly image sits , And in the self-same seat sits Collatine .
That eye which looks on her confounds his wits ; That eye which him <unk> , as more divine , Unto a view so false will not incline , But with a pure appeal seeks to the heart , Which once corrupted takes the worser part ; And therein <unk> up his servile powers , Who , flattered by their leader ’ s <unk> show , <unk> up his lust , as minutes fill up hours ; And as their captain , so their pride doth grow , <unk> more <unk> tribute than they owe .
By <unk> desire thus madly led , The Roman lord <unk> to Lucrece ’ bed .
The locks between her chamber and his will , Each one by him enforced , retires his ward ; But , as they open , they all rate his ill , Which drives the creeping thief to some regard .
The <unk> <unk> the door to have him heard ; <unk> ’ ring <unk> <unk> to see him there ; They fright him , yet he still <unk> his fear .
As each <unk> <unk> yields him way , Through little <unk> and <unk> of the place The wind wars with his torch , to make him stay , And blows the smoke of it into his face , <unk> his conduct in this case ; But his hot heart , which fond desire doth <unk> , <unk> forth another wind that fires the torch .
And being lighted , by the light he spies <unk> ’ s glove , wherein her needle sticks ; He takes it from the rushes where it lies , And <unk> it , the needle his finger pricks , As who should say , “ This glove to wanton tricks Is not <unk> .
Return again in haste ; Thou seest our mistress ’ ornaments are chaste . ” But all these poor <unk> could not stay him ; He in the worst sense <unk> their denial .
The doors , the wind , the glove that did delay him , He takes for <unk> things of trial ; Or as those bars which stop the hourly dial , Who with a ling ’ ring stay his course doth let , Till every minute pays the hour his debt .
“ So , so , ” quoth he , “ these lets attend the time , Like little <unk> that sometime threat the spring , To add a more <unk> to the prime , And give the <unk> birds more cause to sing .
<unk> pays the <unk> of each precious thing : <unk> rocks , high winds , strong <unk> , <unk> and sands The merchant fears , ere rich at home he lands . ” Now is he come unto the chamber door That <unk> him from the heaven of his thought , Which with a yielding <unk> , and with no more , Hath <unk> him from the blessed thing he sought .
So from himself <unk> hath wrought , That for his prey to pray he doth begin , As if the heavens should countenance his sin .
But in the midst of his <unk> prayer , Having <unk> th ’ eternal power That his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair , And they would stand <unk> to the hour , Even there he starts .
<unk> he , “ I must <unk> .
The powers to whom I pray abhor this fact , How can they then assist me in the act ?
“ Then Love and Fortune be my gods , my guide !
My will is <unk> with resolution .
<unk> are but dreams till their effects be tried ; The <unk> sin is <unk> with <unk> .
Against love ’ s fire fear ’ s frost hath <unk> .
The eye of heaven is out , and <unk> night <unk> the shame that follows sweet delight . ” This said , his guilty hand plucked up the <unk> , And with his knee the door he <unk> wide .
The dove sleeps fast that this <unk> will catch ; Thus treason works ere traitors be <unk> .
Who sees the <unk> serpent steps aside ; But she , sound sleeping , fearing no such thing , Lies at the mercy of his mortal sting .
Into the chamber <unk> he <unk> , And <unk> on her yet <unk> bed .
The <unk> being close , about he walks , <unk> his <unk> eyeballs in his head .
By their high treason is his heart misled , Which gives the <unk> to his hand full soon To draw the cloud that hides the silver moon .
Look as the fair and <unk> sun , <unk> from forth a cloud , <unk> our sight ; Even so , the curtain drawn , his eyes begun To wink , being <unk> with a greater light .
Whether it is that she <unk> so bright , That <unk> them , or else some shame supposed ; But blind they are , and keep themselves <unk> .
O , had they in that <unk> prison died , Then had they seen the period of their ill !
Then Collatine again by Lucrece ’ side In his clear bed might have <unk> still .
But they must ope , this blessed league to kill ; And <unk> Lucrece to their sight Must sell her joy , her life , her world ’ s delight .
Her lily hand her <unk> cheek lies under , <unk> ’ ning the pillow of a lawful kiss ; Who , therefore angry , seems to part in sunder , <unk> on either side to want his bliss ; Between whose hills her head <unk> is , Where like a virtuous monument she lies , To be admired of lewd <unk> eyes .
Without the bed her other fair hand was , On the green <unk> ; whose perfect white <unk> like an April <unk> on the grass , With <unk> sweat <unk> dew of night .
Her eyes , like <unk> , had <unk> their light , And <unk> in darkness sweetly lay , Till they might open to <unk> the day .
Her hair , like golden <unk> , played with her breath : O modest <unk> , wanton modesty !
Showing life ’ s triumph in the map of death , And death ’ s dim look in life ’ s mortality .
Each in her sleep themselves so <unk> , As if between them twain there were no strife , But that life lived in death and death in life .
Her breasts like <unk> <unk> <unk> with blue , A pair of maiden <unk> <unk> , Save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew , And him by oath they truly honoured .
These <unk> in Tarquin new ambition bred ; Who , like a foul <unk> , went about From this fair throne to heave the owner out .
What could he see but mightily he noted ?
What did he note but strongly he desired ?
What he beheld , on that he <unk> <unk> , And in his will his wilful eye he tired .
With more than admiration he admired Her <unk> veins , her <unk> skin , Her <unk> lips , her <unk> <unk> chin .
As the grim lion <unk> o ’ er his prey , <unk> hunger by the conquest satisfied , So o ’ er this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay , His rage of lust by <unk> <unk> — <unk> , not <unk> ; for standing by her side , His eye , which late this mutiny <unk> , Unto a greater <unk> <unk> his veins .
And they , like <unk> slaves for <unk> fighting , <unk> <unk> fell <unk> <unk> , In bloody death and <unk> <unk> , Nor children ’ s tears nor mothers ’ groans <unk> , <unk> in their pride , the <unk> still <unk> .
Anon his beating heart , alarum <unk> , Gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking .
His <unk> heart <unk> up his burning eye , His eye commends the leading to his hand ; His hand , as proud of such a dignity , <unk> with pride , <unk> on to make his stand On her bare breast , the heart of all her land ; Whose ranks of blue veins , as his hand did scale , Left their round <unk> <unk> and pale .
They , must ’ ring to the quiet <unk> Where their dear <unk> and lady lies , Do tell her she is <unk> <unk> , And fright her with confusion of their cries .
She , much amazed , breaks ope her <unk> eyes , Who , <unk> forth this <unk> to behold , Are by his <unk> torch <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> her as one in dead of night From forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking , That thinks she hath beheld some <unk> <unk> , Whose grim aspect sets every joint a shaking .
What terror ’ tis !
but she , in worser taking , From sleep <unk> , <unk> doth view The sight which makes supposed terror true .
<unk> and confounded in a thousand fears , Like to a <unk> bird she trembling lies .
She dares not look ; yet , winking , there appears <unk> <unk> , ugly in her eyes .
Such shadows are the weak brain ’ s <unk> ; Who , angry that the eyes fly from their lights , In darkness <unk> them with more dreadful sights .
His hand , that yet remains upon her breast , <unk> <unk> , to <unk> such an <unk> wall !
May feel her heart , poor <unk> , distressed , <unk> itself to death , rise up and fall , <unk> her bulk , that his hand shakes withal .
This moves in him more rage , and lesser pity , To make the breach and enter this sweet city .
First , like a trumpet doth his tongue begin To sound a parley to his <unk> foe , Who o ’ er the white sheet peers her <unk> chin , The reason of this rash <unk> to know , Which he by dumb <unk> seeks to show ; But she with <unk> prayers <unk> still Under what colour he <unk> this ill .
Thus he replies : “ The colour in thy face , That even for anger makes the lily pale , And the red rose blush at her own disgrace , Shall plead for me and tell my loving tale .
Under that colour am I come to scale Thy <unk> <unk> ; the fault is thine , For those thine eyes betray thee unto mine .
“ Thus I <unk> thee , if thou mean to chide : Thy beauty hath <unk> thee to this night , Where thou with patience must my will abide , My will that marks thee for my earth ’ s delight , Which I to conquer sought with all my might .
But as reproof and reason beat it dead , By thy bright beauty was it newly bred .
“ I see what crosses my attempt will bring ; I know what thorns the growing rose <unk> ; I think the honey guarded with a sting ; All this <unk> counsel <unk> .
But will is deaf , and hears no <unk> friends ; Only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty , And dotes on what he looks , ’ gainst law or duty .
“ I have <unk> , even in my soul , What wrong , what shame , what sorrow I shall breed ; But nothing can affection ’ s course control , Or stop the <unk> fury of his speed .
I know <unk> tears ensue the deed , <unk> , disdain , and deadly enmity ; Yet strike I to embrace mine infamy . ” This said , he shakes aloft his Roman blade , Which , like a falcon <unk> ’ ring in the skies , <unk> the fowl below with his wings ’ shade , Whose crooked <unk> threats , if he mount he dies .
So under his <unk> <unk> lies <unk> <unk> , <unk> what he tells With trembling fear , as fowl hear falcon ’ s bells .
“ Lucrece , ” quoth he , “ this night I must enjoy thee .
If thou deny , then force must work my way , For in thy bed I purpose to destroy thee ; That done , some worthless slave of thine I ’ ll slay .
To kill thine honour with thy life ’ s decay ; And in thy dead arms do I mean to place him , <unk> I slew him , seeing thee embrace him .
“ So thy <unk> husband shall remain The scornful mark of every open eye ; Thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain , Thy issue <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
And thou , the author of their <unk> , <unk> have thy trespass <unk> up in rhymes And sung by children in succeeding times .
“ But if thou yield , I rest thy secret friend .
The fault unknown is as a thought <unk> ; A little harm done to a great good end For lawful policy remains <unk> .
The poisonous simple sometimes is <unk> In a pure compound ; being so <unk> , His venom in effect is <unk> .
“ Then , for thy husband and thy children ’ s sake , <unk> my suit .
<unk> not to their <unk> The shame that from them no device can take , The blemish that will never be forgot , Worse than a <unk> wipe , or <unk> ’ s blot : For marks <unk> in men ’ s nativity Are nature ’ s faults , not their own infamy . ” Here with a <unk> ’ <unk> eye He <unk> up himself and makes a pause ; While she , the picture of pure <unk> , Like a white hind under the gripe ’ s sharp <unk> , <unk> in a <unk> where are no laws , To the rough beast that knows no gentle right , Nor aught <unk> but his foul appetite .
But when a <unk> cloud the world doth threat , In his dim <unk> th ’ <unk> mountains <unk> , From earth ’ s dark womb some gentle <unk> doth get , Which blows these <unk> vapours from their <unk> , <unk> ’ ring their present fall by this <unk> ; So his <unk> haste her words delays , And moody <unk> <unk> while <unk> plays .
Yet , foul <unk> cat , he doth but dally , While in his <unk> foot the weak mouse <unk> .
Her sad behaviour feeds his <unk> folly , A <unk> gulf that even in plenty <unk> .
His ear her prayers <unk> , but his heart <unk> No <unk> entrance to her <unk> ; Tears <unk> lust , though marble wear with <unk> .
Her <unk> eyes are sadly fixed In the <unk> wrinkles of his face .
Her modest eloquence with sighs is <unk> , Which to her <unk> <unk> more grace .
She puts the period often from his place , And midst the sentence so her accent breaks That twice she doth begin ere once she speaks .
She <unk> him by high <unk> Jove , By knighthood , gentry , and sweet friendship ’ s oath , By her untimely tears , her husband ’ s love , By holy human law , and common troth , By heaven and earth , and all the power of both , That to his borrowed bed he make retire , And stoop to honour , not to foul desire .
<unk> she , “ <unk> not <unk> With such black payment as thou hast <unk> ; <unk> not the fountain that gave drink to thee , <unk> not the thing that cannot be <unk> .
<unk> thy ill aim before the shoot be ended ; He is no <unk> that doth bend his bow To strike a poor <unk> doe .
“ My husband is thy friend ; for his sake spare me .
Thyself art mighty ; for thine own sake leave me .
Myself a <unk> , do not then <unk> me ; Thou look ’ st not like deceit ; do not deceive me .
My sighs , like <unk> , labour hence to heave thee .
If ever man were moved with woman ’ s <unk> , Be moved with my tears , my sighs , my groans .
“ All which together , like a troubled ocean , Beat at thy <unk> and <unk> ’ ning heart , To <unk> it with their continual motion ; For stones <unk> to water do <unk> .
O , if no harder than a stone thou art , <unk> at my tears and be <unk> !
Soft pity enters at an iron gate .
“ In Tarquin ’ s likeness I did entertain thee .
Hast thou put on his shape to do him shame ?
To all the host of heaven I complain me , Thou wrong ’ st his honour , wound ’ st his princely name .
Thou art not what thou seem ’ st ; and if the same , Thou seem ’ st not what thou art , a god , a king ; For kings like gods should govern everything .
“ How will thy shame be <unk> in thine age , When thus thy vices bud before thy spring ?
If in thy hope thou dar ’ st do such outrage , What dar ’ st thou not when once thou art a king ?
O , be remembered , no <unk> thing From vassal actors can be wiped away ; Then kings ’ <unk> cannot be hid in clay .
“ This deed will make thee only loved for fear , But happy <unk> still are feared for love .
With foul offenders thou perforce must bear , When they in thee the like offences prove .
If but for fear of this , thy will remove , For princes are the glass , the school , the book , Where subjects ’ eyes do learn , do read , do look .
“ And wilt thou be the school where <unk> shall learn ?
Must he in thee read <unk> of such shame ?
Wilt thou be glass , wherein it shall discern <unk> for sin , warrant for blame , To privilege dishonour in thy name ?
Thou back ’ st reproach against <unk> <unk> , And mak ’ st fair reputation but a bawd .
“ Hast thou command ?
By him that gave it thee , From a pure heart command thy rebel will .
Draw not thy sword to guard iniquity , For it was lent thee all that brood to kill .
Thy princely office how canst thou <unk> , When , <unk> by thy fault , foul <unk> may say He learned to sin , and thou didst teach the way ?
“ Think but how vile a spectacle it were To view thy present trespass in another .
Men ’ s faults do seldom to themselves appear ; Their own <unk> <unk> they smother .
This guilt would seem <unk> in thy brother .
O how are they <unk> in with <unk> That from their own <unk> <unk> their eyes !
“ To thee , to thee , my <unk> hands appeal , Not to <unk> lust , thy rash <unk> .
I sue for <unk> majesty ’ s repeal ; Let him return , and <unk> ’ ring thoughts retire .
His true respect will prison false desire , And wipe the dim <unk> from thy doting eyne , That thou shalt see thy state , and pity mine . ” “ Have done , ” quoth he .
“ My <unk> tide Turns not , but swells the higher by this let .
Small lights are soon blown out , huge fires abide , And with the wind in greater fury fret .
The petty streams that pay a daily debt To their salt sovereign , with their fresh falls ’ haste <unk> to his flow , but alter not his taste . ” “ Thou art , ” quoth she , “ a sea , a sovereign king , And , lo , there falls into thy boundless flood Black lust , dishonour , shame , <unk> , Who seek to stain the ocean of thy blood .
If all these petty ills shall change thy good , Thy sea within a <unk> ’ s womb is <unk> , And not the <unk> in thy sea dispersed .
“ So shall these slaves be king , and thou their slave ; Thou nobly base , they basely <unk> ; Thou their fair life , and they thy <unk> grave ; Thou loathed in their shame , they in thy pride .
The lesser thing should not the greater hide ; The cedar <unk> not to the base <unk> ’ s foot , But low <unk> wither at the cedar ’ s root .
“ So let thy thoughts , low <unk> to thy state ” — “ No more , ” quoth he , “ by heaven , I will not hear thee .
Yield to my love .
If not , enforced hate , <unk> of love ’ s <unk> touch , shall <unk> tear thee .
That done , <unk> I mean to bear thee Unto the base bed of some rascal groom , To be thy partner in this shameful doom . ” This said , he sets his foot upon the light , For light and lust are deadly enemies .
Shame <unk> up in blind <unk> night , When most unseen , then most doth <unk> .
The wolf hath seized his prey , the poor lamb cries , Till with her own white fleece her voice <unk> <unk> her <unk> in her lips ’ sweet fold .
For with the nightly linen that she wears He <unk> her piteous clamours in her head , <unk> his hot face in the <unk> tears That ever modest eyes with sorrow shed .
O , that <unk> lust should stain so pure a bed !
The spots whereof could weeping <unk> , Her tears should drop on them <unk> .
But she hath lost a dearer thing than life , And he hath won what he would lose again .
This forced league doth force a further strife ; This <unk> joy breeds months of pain ; This hot desire <unk> to cold disdain .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> of her store , And <unk> , the thief , far <unk> than before .
Look as the <unk> hound or <unk> hawk , <unk> for tender smell or speedy flight , Make slow pursuit , or altogether <unk> The prey wherein by nature they delight ; So <unk> Tarquin fares this night .
His taste <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , <unk> his will , that lived by foul <unk> .
O deeper sin than <unk> conceit Can <unk> in still imagination !
<unk> desire must <unk> his receipt , Ere he can see his own <unk> .
While lust is in his pride no <unk> Can curb his heat or rein his rash desire , Till , like a jade , <unk> himself doth tire .
And then with <unk> and lean <unk> cheek , With heavy eye , knit brow , and <unk> pace , <unk> desire , all recreant , poor , and <unk> , Like to a <unk> beggar <unk> his case .
The flesh being proud , desire doth fight with Grace , For there it revels ; and when that <unk> , The guilty rebel for <unk> prays .
So fares it with this <unk> lord of Rome , Who this <unk> so <unk> <unk> ; For now against himself he sounds this doom , That through the length of times he stands disgraced .
Besides , his soul ’ s fair temple is <unk> , To whose weak <unk> muster troops of cares , To ask the spotted princess how she fares .
She says her subjects with foul <unk> Have <unk> down her <unk> wall , And by their mortal fault brought in <unk> Her <unk> , and made her thrall To living death and pain perpetual , Which in her <unk> she <unk> still , But her <unk> could not <unk> their will .
E ’ en in this thought through the dark night he <unk> , A captive victor that hath lost in gain , Bearing away the wound that nothing <unk> , The scar that will , despite of cure , remain ; Leaving his spoil <unk> in greater pain .
She bears the load of lust he left behind , And he the burden of a guilty mind .
He like a <unk> dog <unk> sadly thence ; She like a <unk> lamb lies <unk> there ; He <unk> , and hates himself for his offence ; She , desperate , with her nails her flesh doth tear .
He faintly flies , sweating with guilty fear ; She stays , <unk> on the <unk> night ; He runs , and chides his <unk> , loathed delight .
He thence <unk> a heavy <unk> ; She there remains a <unk> <unk> .
He in his speed looks for the morning light ; She prays she never may behold the day .
“ For day , ” quoth she , “ night ’ s <unk> doth open lay , And my true eyes have never <unk> how To cloak offences with a cunning brow .
“ They think not but that every eye can see The same disgrace which they themselves behold ; And therefore would they still in darkness be , To have their unseen sin remain <unk> .
For they their guilt with weeping will unfold , And grave , like water that doth eat in steel , Upon my cheeks what <unk> shame I feel . ” Here she <unk> against repose and rest , And bids her eyes hereafter still be blind .
She wakes her heart by beating on her breast , And bids it leap from thence , where it may find Some <unk> chest , to close so pure a mind .
<unk> with grief thus breathes she forth her spite Against the unseen secrecy of night .
“ O <unk> night , image of hell , <unk> <unk> and <unk> of shame , Black stage for <unk> and murders fell , <unk> <unk> <unk> , nurse of blame , <unk> muffled bawd , dark harbour for <unk> , <unk> cave of death , <unk> ’ ring <unk> With <unk> treason and the <unk> !
“ O hateful , <unk> , and <unk> night , Since thou art guilty of my <unk> crime , <unk> thy <unk> to meet the <unk> light , Make war against <unk> course of time ; Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb His wonted height , yet ere he go to bed , <unk> poisonous clouds about his golden head .

And let thy <unk> vapours march so thick , That in their <unk> ranks his smothered light May set at noon and make perpetual night .
“ Were Tarquin night , as he is but night ’ s child , The <unk> queen he would <unk> ; Her <unk> <unk> too , by him <unk> , Through <unk> ’ s black bosom should not peep again .
So should I have <unk> in my pain ; And fellowship in woe doth woe <unk> , As <unk> ’ chat makes short their pilgrimage .
“ Where now I have no one to blush with me , To cross their arms and hang their heads with mine , To mask their brows , and hide their infamy ; But I alone alone must sit and pine , <unk> the earth with showers of silver brine , <unk> my talk with tears , my grief with groans , Poor <unk> <unk> of lasting <unk> .
“ O night , thou <unk> of foul <unk> smoke , Let not the jealous day behold that face Which underneath thy black <unk> cloak <unk> lies <unk> with disgrace !
Keep still possession of thy <unk> place , That all the faults which in thy reign are made May likewise be <unk> in thy shade .
“ Make me not object to the <unk> day .
The light will show <unk> in my brow The story of sweet chastity ’ s decay , The <unk> breach of holy wedlock vow .
Yea , the <unk> , that know not how To <unk> what is writ in learned books , Will <unk> my loathsome trespass in my looks .
“ The nurse , to still her child , will tell my story And fright her crying babe with Tarquin ’ s name .
The orator , to deck his <unk> , Will couple my reproach to Tarquin ’ s shame .

“ Let my good name , that senseless reputation , For Collatine ’ s dear love be kept <unk> .
If that be made a theme for <unk> , The branches of another root are <unk> , And <unk> reproach to him <unk> That is as clear from this attaint of mine As I , ere this , was pure to Collatine .
“ O unseen shame , invisible disgrace !
O <unk> sore , <unk> , private scar !
<unk> is stamped in <unk> ’ face , And Tarquin ’ s eye may read the <unk> afar , How he in peace is wounded , not in war .
Alas , how many bear such shameful blows , Which not themselves , but he that gives them knows !
“ If , Collatine , thine honour lay in me , From me by strong assault it is bereft .
My honey lost , and I , a <unk> <unk> , Have no perfection of my summer left , But robbed and <unk> by injurious theft .
In thy weak <unk> a wand ’ ring <unk> hath crept , And <unk> the honey which thy chaste <unk> kept .
“ Yet am I guilty of thy honour ’ s wrack ; Yet for thy honour did I entertain him .
Coming from thee , I could not put him back , For it had been dishonour to disdain him .
Besides , of <unk> he did complain him , And talked of virtue .

“ Why should the worm <unk> the maiden bud ?
Or hateful <unk> hatch in <unk> ’ <unk> ?
Or <unk> infect fair <unk> with venom mud ?

But no perfection is so absolute That some <unk> doth not <unk> .
“ The aged man that coffers up his gold Is <unk> with <unk> , and <unk> and painful fits , And scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold , But like <unk> <unk> he sits , And <unk> <unk> the harvest of his wits , Having no other pleasure of his gain But torment that it cannot cure his pain .
“ So then he hath it when he cannot use it , And leaves it to be <unk> by his young , Who in their pride do presently abuse it .
Their father was too weak , and they too strong , To hold their <unk> fortune long .

“ O that is gone for which I sought to live , And therefore now I need not fear to die .

“ Well , well , dear Collatine , thou shalt not know The stained taste of <unk> troth ; I will not wrong thy true affection so , To flatter thee with an <unk> oath .

My tongue shall utter all ; mine eyes , like <unk> , As from a <unk> that feeds a <unk> , Shall <unk> pure streams to purge my <unk> tale . ” By this , <unk> Philomel had ended The <unk> <unk> of her nightly sorrow , And solemn night with slow sad gait descended To ugly hell ; when , lo , the blushing morrow <unk> light to all fair eyes that light will borrow .
But cloudy Lucrece shames herself to see , And therefore still in night would <unk> be .
<unk> day through every <unk> spies , And seems to point her out where she sits weeping , To whom she <unk> speaks : “ O eye of eyes , Why pry ’ st thou through my window ?
Leave thy <unk> , <unk> with thy <unk> beams eyes that are sleeping .

True grief is fond and testy as a child , Who wayward once , his mood with naught <unk> .
Old woes , not infant sorrows , bear them mild .
<unk> <unk> the one ; the other wild , Like an <unk> <unk> <unk> still With too much labour <unk> for want of skill .
So she , <unk> in a sea of care , Holds <unk> with each thing she <unk> , And to herself all sorrow doth compare ; No object but her passion ’ s strength <unk> , And as one <unk> , another straight <unk> .
Sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words ; Sometime ’ tis mad and too much talk affords .
The little birds that tune their morning ’ s joy Make her <unk> mad with their sweet <unk> .
For mirth doth search the bottom of annoy ; Sad souls are slain in merry company .
Grief best is pleased with grief ’ s society ; True sorrow then is <unk> <unk> When with like semblance it is <unk> .
’ Tis double death to drown in <unk> of shore ; He ten times <unk> that <unk> beholding food ; To see the salve doth make the wound ache more ; Great grief grieves most at that would do it good ; Deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood , Who , being stopped , the <unk> banks o ’ <unk> ; Grief <unk> with nor law nor limit knows .
“ You mocking birds , ” quoth she , “ your tunes <unk> Within your <unk> <unk> breasts , And in my hearing be you mute and dumb ; My <unk> discord loves no stops nor rests .
A woeful hostess <unk> not merry guests .
<unk> your nimble notes to pleasing ears ; <unk> likes <unk> when time is kept with tears .
“ Come , Philomel , that sing ’ st of <unk> , Make thy sad grove in my <unk> hair .
As the <unk> earth weeps at thy <unk> , So I at each sad strain will strain a tear And with deep groans the <unk> bear ; For <unk> I ’ ll <unk> on Tarquin still , While thou on <unk> <unk> better skill .
“ And whiles against a thorn thou bear ’ st thy part To keep thy sharp woes waking , wretched I , To imitate thee well , against my heart Will fix a sharp knife to affright mine eye , Who if it wink shall <unk> fall and die .
These means , as frets upon an instrument , Shall tune our <unk> to true <unk> .
“ And for , poor bird , thou sing ’ st not in the day , As <unk> any eye should thee behold , Some dark deep desert seated from the way , That knows not <unk> heat nor <unk> cold , Will we find out ; and there we will unfold To creatures stern sad tunes to change their kinds .
Since men prove beasts , let beasts bear gentle minds . ” As the poor frighted deer that stands at gaze , <unk> <unk> which way to fly , Or one <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , That cannot tread the way out <unk> ; So with herself is she in mutiny , To live or die which of the twain were better , When life is shamed and Death reproach ’ s debtor .
“ To kill myself , ” quoth she , “ alack , what were it , But with my body my poor soul ’ s <unk> ?
They that lose half with greater patience bear it Than they whose whole is swallowed in confusion .
That mother <unk> a <unk> conclusion Who , having two sweet babes , when death takes one , Will slay the other , and be nurse to none .
“ My body or my soul , which was the dearer , When the one pure , the other made divine ?
Whose love of either to myself was nearer , When both were kept for heaven and Collatine ?
Ay me , the bark <unk> from the lofty pine , His leaves will wither and his sap decay ; So must my soul , her bark being <unk> away .
“ Her house is <unk> , her quiet <unk> , Her mansion <unk> by the enemy , Her sacred temple spotted , <unk> , corrupted , <unk> <unk> with daring infamy .
Then let it not be called <unk> , If in this <unk> <unk> I make some hole Through which I may convey this troubled soul .
“ Yet die I will not till my Collatine Have heard the cause of my untimely death , That he may vow , in that sad hour of mine , Revenge on him that made me stop my breath .
My stained blood to Tarquin I ’ ll bequeath , Which by him tainted shall for him be spent , And as his due writ in my testament .
“ My honour I ’ ll bequeath unto the knife That wounds my body so dishonoured .
’ Tis honour to <unk> dishonoured life ; The one will live , the other being dead .
So of shame ’ s ashes shall my fame be bred , For in my death I murder shameful scorn ; My shame so dead , mine honour is new born .
“ Dear lord of that dear jewel I have lost , What <unk> shall I bequeath to thee ?
My resolution , love , shall be thy boast , By whose example thou revenged mayst be .
How Tarquin must be used , read it in me ; Myself , thy friend , will kill myself , thy foe , And for my sake serve thou false Tarquin so .
“ This brief <unk> of my will I make : My soul and body to the skies and ground ; My resolution , husband , do thou take ; Mine honour be the knife ’ s that makes my wound ; My shame be his that did my fame confound ; And all my fame that lives <unk> be To those that live and think no shame of me .
“ Thou , Collatine , shalt <unk> this will ; How was I <unk> that thou shalt see it !
My blood shall wash the slander of mine ill ; My life ’ s foul deed my life ’ s fair end shall free it .
<unk> not , faint heart , but <unk> say , ‘ So be it . ’ Yield to my hand ; my hand shall conquer thee .
Thou dead , both die , and both shall victors be . ” This plot of death when sadly she had laid , And wiped the <unk> pearl from her bright eyes , With <unk> tongue she <unk> called her maid , Whose swift obedience to her mistress <unk> ; For <unk> duty with thought ’ s feathers flies .
Poor Lucrece ’ cheeks unto her maid seem so As winter <unk> when sun doth melt their snow .
Her mistress she doth give <unk> <unk> , With soft slow tongue , true mark of modesty , And sorts a sad look to her lady ’ s sorrow , For why her face wore sorrow ’ s livery , But durst not ask of her <unk> Why her two suns were <unk> so , Nor why her fair cheeks <unk> with woe .
But as the earth doth weep , the sun being set , Each flower <unk> like a melting eye , Even so the maid with swelling drops ’ <unk> wet Her <unk> eyne , enforced by sympathy Of those fair suns set in her mistress ’ sky , Who in a <unk> ocean quench their light , Which makes the maid weep like the <unk> night .
A pretty while these pretty creatures stand , Like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
One justly weeps ; the other takes in hand No cause , but company , of her drops <unk> .
Their gentle sex to weep are often willing , <unk> themselves to guess at others ’ <unk> , And then they drown their eyes or break their hearts .
For men have marble , women waxen , minds , And therefore are they <unk> as marble will ; The weak oppressed , th ’ impression of strange kinds Is <unk> in them by force , by <unk> , or skill .
Then call them not the <unk> of their ill , No more than wax shall be <unk> evil , Wherein is stamped the semblance of a devil .
Their <unk> , like a goodly <unk> plain , <unk> open all the little worms that creep ; In men , as in a <unk> grove , remain <unk> evils that <unk> sleep .
Through crystal walls each little <unk> will peep .
Though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks , Poor women ’ s faces are their own faults ’ books .
No man <unk> against the withered flower , But chide rough winter that the flower hath killed ; Not that <unk> , but that which doth devour , Is worthy blame .
O , let it not be <unk> Poor women ’ s faults , that they are so <unk> With men ’ s abuses !
Those proud lords , to blame , Make <unk> women <unk> to their shame .
The precedent whereof in Lucrece view , <unk> by night with circumstances strong Of present death , and shame that might ensue By that her death , to do her husband wrong .
Such danger to <unk> did belong , The dying fear through all her body spread ; And who cannot abuse a body dead ?
By this , mild patience bid fair Lucrece speak To the poor counterfeit of her <unk> : “ My girl , ” quoth she , “ on what occasion break Those tears from thee , that down thy cheeks are <unk> ?
If thou dost weep for grief of my <unk> , Know , gentle wench , it small <unk> my mood .
If tears could help , mine own would do me good .
“ But tell me , girl , when went ” — and there she stayed Till after a deep groan — “ Tarquin from hence ? ” “ Madam , ere I was up , ” replied the maid , “ The more to blame my <unk> negligence .
Yet with the fault I thus far can dispense : Myself was stirring ere the break of day , And , ere I rose , was Tarquin gone away .
“ But , lady , if your maid may be so bold , She would request to know your heaviness . ” “ O peace ! ” quoth Lucrece .
“ If it should be told , The repetition cannot make it less ; For more it is than I can well express , And that deep torture may be called a hell , When more is felt than one hath power to tell .
“ Go , get me hither paper , ink , and pen .
Yet save that labour , for I have them here .
What should I say ? — One of my husband ’ s men Bid thou be ready by and by to bear A letter to my lord , my love , my dear .
Bid him with speed prepare to carry it ; The cause craves haste , and it will soon be writ . ” Her maid is gone , and she <unk> to write , First <unk> o ’ er the paper with her <unk> .
<unk> and grief an eager combat fight ; What wit sets down is <unk> straight with will ; This is too <unk> , this blunt and ill . Much like a press of people at a door , <unk> her <unk> , which shall go before .
At last she thus begins : “ Thou worthy lord Of that unworthy wife that <unk> thee , Health to thy person !
Next vouchsafe t ’ afford , If ever , love , thy Lucrece thou wilt see , Some present speed to come and visit me .
So I commend me from our house in grief .
My woes are tedious , though my words are brief . ” Here <unk> she up the tenor of her woe , Her certain sorrow writ <unk> .
By this short <unk> Collatine may know Her grief , but not her grief ’ s true quality ; She dares not thereof make discovery , Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse , Ere she with blood had stained her stained excuse .
Besides , the life and feeling of her passion She <unk> , to spend when he is by to hear her ; When sighs and groans and tears may grace the fashion Of her disgrace , the better so to clear her From that suspicion which the world might bear her .
To shun this blot , she would not blot the letter With words , till action might become them better .
To see sad sights moves more than hear them told , For then the eye <unk> to the ear The heavy motion that it doth behold , When every part a part of woe doth bear .
’ Tis but a part of sorrow that we hear .
Deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow <unk> , And sorrow <unk> , being blown with wind of words .
Her letter now is sealed , and on it writ “ At <unk> to my lord with more than haste . ” The post attends , and she delivers it , <unk> the <unk> groom to hie as fast As <unk> <unk> before the northern blast .
Speed more than speed but dull and slow she <unk> ; <unk> still <unk> such extremes .
The homely villain <unk> to her low , And , blushing on her with a <unk> eye , <unk> the scroll without or yea or no , And forth with <unk> innocence doth hie .
But they whose guilt within their bosoms lie <unk> every eye <unk> their blame , For Lucrece thought he <unk> to see her shame , When , silly groom !
God wot , it was defect Of spirit , life , and bold <unk> .
Such harmless creatures have a true respect To talk in deeds , while others <unk> <unk> more speed , but do it <unk> .
Even so this pattern of the <unk> age <unk> honest looks , but laid no words to gage .
His <unk> duty <unk> her mistrust , That two red fires in both their faces <unk> ; She thought he <unk> , as knowing Tarquin ’ s lust , And , blushing with him , <unk> on him <unk> .
Her earnest eye did make him more amazed .
The more she saw the blood his cheeks <unk> , The more she thought he spied in her some blemish .
But long she thinks till he return again , And yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone .
The weary time she cannot entertain , For now ’ tis stale to sigh , to weep , to groan ; So woe hath <unk> woe , moan tired moan , That she her <unk> a little while doth stay , <unk> for means to mourn some <unk> way .
At last she calls to mind where hangs a piece Of <unk> painting , made for Priam ’ s Troy , Before the which is drawn the power of Greece , For Helen ’ s rape the city to destroy , <unk> ’ ning <unk> <unk> with annoy ; Which the <unk> painter drew so proud , As heaven , it seemed , to kiss the <unk> bowed .
A thousand lamentable objects there , In scorn of Nature , Art gave <unk> life .
Many a dry drop seemed a weeping tear , <unk> for the slaughtered husband by the wife .
The red blood <unk> to show the painter ’ s strife , The dying eyes <unk> forth their <unk> lights , Like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights .
There might you see the labouring <unk> <unk> with sweat and <unk> all with dust ; And from the towers of Troy there would appear The very eyes of men through <unk> thrust , <unk> upon the Greeks with little lust .
Such sweet observance in this work was had , That one might see those <unk> eyes look sad .
In great commanders grace and majesty You might behold , <unk> in their faces ; In youth , quick bearing and <unk> ; And here and there the painter <unk> <unk> cowards marching on with trembling <unk> , Which <unk> <unk> did so well resemble , That one would swear he saw them quake and tremble .
In Ajax and Ulysses , O , what art Of <unk> might one behold !
The face of either <unk> either ’ s heart ; Their face their manners most expressly told .
In Ajax ’ eyes blunt rage and rigour <unk> , But the mild glance that sly Ulysses lent <unk> deep regard and smiling government .
There <unk> might you see grave Nestor stand , As ’ twere <unk> the Greeks to fight , Making such sober action with his hand That it beguiled <unk> , <unk> the sight .
In speech , it seemed , his beard , all silver white , <unk> up and down , and from his lips did fly <unk> <unk> breath , which <unk> up to the sky .
About him were a press of gaping faces , Which seemed to swallow up his sound advice , All <unk> list ’ ning , but with several graces , As if some <unk> did their ears <unk> ; Some high , some low , the painter was so nice .
The <unk> of many , almost hid behind , To jump up higher seemed to mock the mind .
Here one man ’ s hand <unk> on another ’ s head , His nose being <unk> by his neighbour ’ s ear ; Here one being <unk> bears back , all <unk> ’ n and red ; Another smothered seems to <unk> and swear ; And in their rage such signs of rage they bear As , but for loss of Nestor ’ s golden words , It seemed they would debate with angry swords .
For much imaginary work was there , <unk> <unk> , so compact , so kind , That for Achilles ’ image stood his spear <unk> in an armed hand ; himself , behind , Was left unseen , save to the eye of mind .
A hand , a foot , a face , a leg , a head , Stood for the whole to be <unk> .
And from the walls of <unk> Troy , When their brave hope , bold Hector , <unk> to field , Stood many Trojan mothers , <unk> joy To see their youthful sons bright weapons <unk> ; And to their hope they such odd action yield That through their light joy seemed to appear , Like bright things stained , a kind of heavy fear .
And from the <unk> of <unk> , where they fought , To <unk> ’ <unk> banks the red blood ran , Whose waves to imitate the battle sought With swelling <unk> , and their ranks began To break upon the galled shore , and then <unk> again till , meeting greater ranks , They join , and shoot their <unk> at <unk> ’ banks .
To this <unk> piece is Lucrece come , To find a face where all distress is <unk> .
Many she sees where cares have <unk> some , But none where all distress and <unk> <unk> , Till she <unk> Hecuba beheld , <unk> on Priam ’ s wounds with her old eyes , Which bleeding under Pyrrhus ’ proud foot lies .
In her the painter had <unk> Time ’ s ruin , beauty ’ s wrack , and grim care ’ s reign .
Her cheeks with <unk> and wrinkles were disguised ; Of what she was no semblance did remain .
Her blue blood , changed to black in every vein , <unk> the spring that those <unk> <unk> had fed , <unk> life <unk> in a body dead .
On this sad shadow Lucrece <unk> her eyes , And shapes her sorrow to the <unk> ’ s woes , Who nothing wants to answer her but cries And bitter words to <unk> her cruel foes .
The painter was no god to lend her those , And therefore Lucrece swears he did her wrong , To give her so much grief , and not a tongue .
“ Poor instrument , ” quoth she , “ without a sound , I ’ ll tune thy woes with my <unk> tongue , And drop sweet balm in Priam ’ s painted wound , And rail on Pyrrhus that hath done him wrong , And with my tears quench Troy that burns so long , And with my knife scratch out the angry eyes Of all the Greeks that are thine enemies .
“ Show me the strumpet that began this stir , That with my nails her beauty I may tear .
Thy heat of lust , fond Paris , did <unk> This load of wrath that burning Troy doth bear ; Thy eye <unk> the fire that <unk> here , And here in Troy , for trespass of thine eye , The sire , the son , the dame , and daughter die .
“ Why should the private pleasure of some one Become the public plague of many moe ?
Let sin , alone committed , light alone Upon his head that hath <unk> so ; Let guiltless souls be <unk> from guilty woe .
For one ’ s offence why should so many fall , To plague a private sin in general ?
“ Lo , here weeps Hecuba , here Priam dies , Here manly Hector faints , here Troilus <unk> ; Here friend by friend in bloody channel lies , And friend to friend gives <unk> wounds , And one man ’ s lust these many lives confounds .
Had doting Priam <unk> his son ’ s desire , Troy had been bright with fame and not with fire . ” Here <unk> she weeps Troy ’ s painted woes , For sorrow , like a <unk> bell , Once set on <unk> , with his own weight goes ; Then little strength rings out the <unk> knell .
So Lucrece set <unk> , sad tales doth tell To <unk> <unk> and <unk> sorrow ; She lends them words , and she their looks doth borrow .
She throws her eyes about the painting round , And who she finds forlorn she doth lament .
At last she sees a wretched image bound , That piteous looks to <unk> shepherds lent .
His face , though full of cares , yet showed content ; <unk> to Troy with the blunt <unk> he goes , So mild , that patience seemed to scorn his woes .
In him the painter laboured with his skill To hide deceit and give the harmless show An humble gait , calm looks , eyes <unk> still , A brow <unk> that seemed to welcome woe , <unk> neither red nor pale , but mingled so That blushing red no guilty instance gave , Nor <unk> pale the fear that false hearts have .
But , like a constant and <unk> devil , He entertained a show so seeming just , And therein so <unk> his secret evil , That jealousy itself could not mistrust <unk> craft and perjury should thrust Into so bright a day such <unk> storms , Or blot with <unk> sin such <unk> forms .
The <unk> <unk> this mild image drew For perjured Sinon , whose <unk> story The credulous Old Priam after slew ; Whose words like <unk> burnt the shining glory Of <unk> <unk> , that the skies were sorry , And little stars shot from their fixed places , When their glass fell wherein they <unk> their faces .
This picture she <unk> <unk> , And chid the painter for his wondrous skill , <unk> some shape in Sinon ’ s was abused ; So fair a form <unk> not a mind so ill . And still on him she <unk> , and gazing still , Such signs of truth in his plain face she spied , That she <unk> the picture was <unk> .
“ It cannot be , ” quoth she , “ that so much <unk> ” — She would have said “ can <unk> in such a look . ” But Tarquin ’ s shape came in her mind the while , And from her tongue “ can <unk> ” from “ cannot ” took .
“ It cannot be ” she in that sense forsook , And turned it thus : “ It cannot be , I find , But such a face should bear a wicked mind .
“ For even as subtle Sinon here is painted , So <unk> , so weary , and so mild , As if with grief or travail he had <unk> , To me came Tarquin armed too , beguiled With outward honesty , but yet <unk> With inward vice .
As Priam him did cherish , So did I Tarquin ; so my Troy did perish .
“ Look , look , how <unk> Priam <unk> his eyes , To see those borrowed tears that Sinon <unk> !
Priam , why art thou old and yet not wise ?
For every tear he falls a Trojan <unk> .
His eye drops fire , no water thence proceeds ; Those round clear pearls of his that move thy pity , Are balls of <unk> fire to burn thy city .
“ Such devils steal effects from <unk> hell , For Sinon in his fire doth quake with cold , And in that cold <unk> fire doth dwell .
These <unk> such <unk> do hold , Only to flatter fools and make them bold ; So Priam ’ s trust false Sinon ’ s tears doth flatter , That he finds means to burn his Troy with water . ” Here , all enraged , such passion her <unk> , That patience is quite beaten from her breast .
She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails , <unk> him to that unhappy guest Whose deed hath made herself herself <unk> .
At last she <unk> with this gives o ’ er ; “ Fool , fool ! ” quoth she , “ his wounds will not be sore . ” Thus <unk> and flows the current of her sorrow , And time doth weary time with her <unk> .
She looks for night , and then she longs for morrow , And both she thinks too long with her <unk> .
<unk> time seems long in sorrow ’ s sharp <unk> .
Though woe be heavy , yet it seldom sleeps , And they that watch see time how slow it <unk> .
Which all this time hath <unk> her thought , That she with painted images hath spent , Being from the feeling of her own grief brought By deep <unk> of others ’ <unk> , <unk> her woes in shows of discontent .
It <unk> some , though none it ever cured , To think their <unk> others have endured .
But now the <unk> messenger , come back , <unk> home his lord and other company ; Who finds his Lucrece <unk> in mourning black , And round about her <unk> eye <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> in the sky .
These <unk> in her dim element <unk> new storms to those already spent .
Which when her <unk> husband saw , <unk> in her sad face he <unk> .
Her eyes , though <unk> in tears , looked red and raw , Her lively colour killed with deadly cares .
He hath no power to ask her how she fares ; Both stood like old acquaintance in a <unk> , <unk> far from home , <unk> ’ ring each other ’ s chance .
At last he takes her by the <unk> hand , And thus begins : “ What <unk> ill event Hath thee befall ’ n , that thou dost trembling stand ?
Sweet love , what spite hath thy fair colour spent ?
Why art thou thus <unk> in discontent ?
<unk> , dear dear , this moody heaviness , And tell thy grief , that we may give redress . ” Three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire , Ere once she can discharge one word of woe .
At length <unk> to answer his desire , She <unk> <unk> to let them know Her honour is ta ’ en prisoner by the foe ; While Collatine and his <unk> lords With sad <unk> long to hear her words .
And now this pale swan in her wat ’ ry nest <unk> the sad <unk> of her certain ending : “ <unk> words , ” quoth she , “ shall fit the trespass best , Where no excuse can give the fault <unk> .
In me more woes than words are now <unk> ; And my <unk> would be drawn out too long , To tell them all with one poor tired tongue .
“ Then be this all the task it hath to say : Dear husband , in the interest of thy bed A stranger came , and on that pillow lay Where thou wast wont to rest thy weary head ; And what wrong else may be <unk> By foul <unk> might be done to me , From that , alas , thy Lucrece is not free .
“ For in the dreadful dead of dark midnight , With shining <unk> in my chamber came A creeping creature with a <unk> light , And softly cried ‘ Awake , thou Roman dame , And entertain my love ; else lasting shame On thee and thine this night I will <unk> , If thou my love ’ s desire do <unk> .
“ ‘ For some <unk> groom of thine , ’ quoth he , ‘ Unless thou yoke thy liking to my will , I ’ ll murder straight , and then I ’ ll slaughter thee And swear I found you where you did <unk> The loathsome act of lust , and so did kill The <unk> in their deed .
This act will be My fame and thy perpetual infamy . ’ “ With this , I did begin to start and cry , And then against my heart he sets his sword , <unk> , unless I took all patiently , I should not live to speak another word ; So should my shame still rest upon record , And never be forgot in mighty Rome The <unk> death of Lucrece and her groom .
“ Mine enemy was strong , my poor self weak , And far the weaker with so strong a fear .
My bloody judge <unk> my tongue to speak ; No rightful plea might plead for justice there .
His scarlet lust came evidence to swear That my poor beauty had <unk> his eyes ; And when the judge is robbed , the prisoner dies .
“ O , teach me how to make mine own excuse , Or at the least , this <unk> let me find : Though my gross blood be stained with this abuse , <unk> and <unk> is my mind ; That was not forced ; that never was inclined To <unk> <unk> , but still pure Doth in her <unk> closet yet endure . ” Lo , here the <unk> merchant of this loss , With head <unk> and voice <unk> up with woe , With sad set eyes and wretched arms <unk> , From lips <unk> pale begins to blow The grief away that stops his answer so .
But wretched as he is , he strives in vain ; What he breathes out his breath drinks up again .
As through an arch the violent roaring tide <unk> the eye that doth behold his haste , Yet in the <unk> <unk> in his pride Back to the strait that forced him on so fast , In rage sent out , <unk> in rage , being past : Even so his sighs , his sorrows make a saw , To push grief on , and back the same grief draw .
Which speechless woe of his poor she <unk> , And his untimely frenzy thus <unk> : “ Dear lord , thy sorrow to my sorrow <unk> Another power ; no flood by <unk> <unk> .
My woe too sensible thy passion <unk> More <unk> .
Let it then suffice To drown one woe , one pair of weeping eyes .
“ And for my sake , when I might charm thee so , For she that was thy Lucrece , now attend me : Be suddenly revenged on my foe , Thine , mine , his own .
Suppose thou dost defend me From what is past .
The help that thou shalt lend me Comes all too late , yet let the traitor die , For <unk> justice feeds iniquity .
“ But ere I name him , you fair lords , ” quoth she , <unk> to those that came with Collatine , “ Shall plight your honourable <unk> to me , With swift pursuit to <unk> this wrong of mine ; For ’ tis a <unk> fair design To chase injustice with revengeful arms .
Knights , by their oaths , should right poor ladies ’ harms . ” At this request , with noble disposition Each present lord began to promise aid , As bound in knighthood to her <unk> , <unk> to hear the hateful foe <unk> .
But she , that yet her sad task hath not said , The <unk> stops .
“ O , speak , ” quoth she , “ How may this forced stain be wiped from me ?
“ What is the quality of my offence , Being <unk> with dreadful circumstance ?
May my pure mind with the foul act dispense , My <unk> honour to advance ?
May any terms acquit me from this chance ?
The <unk> fountain <unk> itself again , And why not I from this <unk> stain ?
With this , they all at once began to say , Her body ’ s stain her mind <unk> <unk> , While with a <unk> smile she turns away The face , that map which deep impression bears Of hard misfortune , <unk> in it with tears .
“ No , no , ” quoth she , “ no dame , hereafter living By my excuse shall claim excuse ’ s giving . ” Here with a sigh , as if her heart would break , She throws forth Tarquin ’ s name : “ He , he , ” she says , But more than “ he ” her poor tongue could not speak ; Till after many <unk> and delays , <unk> <unk> , sick and short <unk> , She <unk> this : “ He , he , fair lords , ’ tis he , That guides this hand to give this wound to me . ” Even here she <unk> in her harmless breast A harmful knife , that thence her soul <unk> .
That blow did bail it from the deep <unk> Of that <unk> prison where it breathed .
Her <unk> sighs unto the clouds <unk> Her winged <unk> , and through her wounds doth fly <unk> ’ s lasting date from <unk> destiny .
<unk> , <unk> with this deadly deed , Stood Collatine and all his <unk> crew , Till Lucrece ’ father that <unk> her bleed , Himself on her <unk> body threw , And from the purple fountain Brutus drew The murd ’ rous knife , and , as it left the place , Her blood , in poor revenge , held it in chase ; And <unk> from her breast , it doth divide In two slow rivers , that the crimson blood <unk> her body in on every side , Who , like a <unk> island , <unk> stood <unk> and <unk> in this fearful flood .
Some of her blood still pure and red <unk> , And some looked black , and that false Tarquin stained .
About the mourning and <unk> face Of that black blood a wat ’ ry <unk> goes , Which seems to weep upon the tainted place ; And ever since , as <unk> Lucrece ’ woes , <unk> blood some watery token shows , And blood <unk> still doth red abide , <unk> at that which is so <unk> .
“ Daughter , dear daughter , ” old <unk> cries , “ That life was mine which thou hast here <unk> .
If in the child the father ’ s image lies , Where shall I live now Lucrece is <unk> ?
Thou wast not to this end from me derived .
If children <unk> <unk> , We are their <unk> , and they none of ours .
“ Poor broken glass , I often did behold In thy sweet semblance my old age new born ; But now that fair fresh mirror , dim and old , Shows me a <unk> death by time <unk> .
O , from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn , And <unk> all the beauty of my glass , That I no more can see what once I was !
“ O time , cease thou thy course and last no longer , If they <unk> to be that should survive !
Shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger , And leave the <unk> ’ ring feeble souls alive ?
The old bees die , the young possess their <unk> .
Then live , sweet Lucrece , live again and see Thy father die , and not thy father thee ! ” By this starts Collatine as from a dream , And bids <unk> give his sorrow place ; And then in <unk> Lucrece ’ bleeding stream He falls , and <unk> the pale fear in his face , And <unk> to die with her a space ; Till manly shame bids him possess his breath , And live to be revenged on her death .
The deep vexation of his inward soul Hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue ; Who , mad that sorrow should his use control Or keep him from <unk> words so long , <unk> to talk ; but through his lips do throng <unk> words , so thick come in his poor heart ’ s aid That no man could distinguish what he said .
Yet sometime “ Tarquin ” was pronounced plain , But through his teeth , as if the name he <unk> .
This <unk> tempest , till it blow up rain , <unk> back his sorrow ’ s tide , to make it more .
At last it <unk> , and busy winds give o ’ er .
Then son and father weep with equal strife Who should weep most , for daughter or for wife .
The one doth call her his , the other his , Yet neither may possess the claim they lay , The father says “ She ’ s mine . ” “ O , mine she is , ” <unk> her husband .
“ Do not take away My sorrow ’ s interest ; let no <unk> say He weeps for her , for she was only mine , And only must be <unk> by Collatine . ” “ O , ” quoth <unk> , “ I did give that life Which she too early and too late hath <unk> . ” “ Woe , woe , ” quoth Collatine , “ she was my wife , I <unk> her , and ’ tis mine that she hath killed . ” “ My daughter ” and “ my wife ” with clamours filled The dispersed air , who , holding Lucrece ’ life , <unk> their cries , “ my daughter ” and “ my wife ” .
Brutus , who plucked the knife from Lucrece ’ side , Seeing such emulation in their woe , <unk> to <unk> his wit in state and pride , <unk> in Lucrece ’ wound his folly ’ s show .
He with the Romans was esteemed so As silly <unk> <unk> are with kings , For <unk> words and <unk> ’ ring foolish things .
But now he throws that shallow habit by , Wherein deep policy did him disguise , And armed his <unk> wits <unk> , To check the tears in <unk> ’ eyes .
“ Thou wronged lord of Rome , ” quoth he , “ arise !
Let my <unk> self , supposed a fool , Now set thy <unk> wit to school .
“ Why , Collatine , is woe the cure for woe ?
Do wounds help wounds , or grief help grievous deeds ?
Is it revenge to give thyself a blow For his foul act by whom thy fair wife <unk> ?
Such childish humour from weak minds proceeds .
Thy wretched wife mistook the matter so , To slay herself , that should have slain her foe .
“ <unk> Roman , do not steep thy heart In such <unk> dew of <unk> , But kneel with me , and help to bear thy part To rouse our Roman gods with <unk> , That they will suffer these <unk> , — Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced , — By our strong arms from forth her fair streets <unk> .
“ Now , by the Capitol that we adore , And by this chaste blood so <unk> stained , By heaven ’ s fair sun that breeds the fat earth ’ s store , By all our country rights in Rome <unk> , And by chaste Lucrece ’ soul that late <unk> Her wrongs to us , and by this bloody knife , We will revenge the death of this true wife . ” This said , he struck his hand upon his breast , And kissed the fatal knife , to end his vow ; And to his <unk> urged the rest , Who , <unk> ’ ring at him , did his words allow .
Then <unk> to the ground their knees they bow , And that deep vow which Brutus made before , He doth again repeat , and that they swore .
When they had sworn to this advised doom , They did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence , To show her bleeding body <unk> Rome , And so to publish Tarquin ’ s foul offence ; Which being done with speedy diligence , The Romans <unk> did give consent To Tarquin ’ s everlasting banishment .

Right <unk> , I know not how I shall offend in <unk> my <unk> lines to your lordship , nor how the world will censure me for <unk> so strong a <unk> to support so weak a <unk> : only , if your honour seem but pleased , I account myself highly praised , and vow to take advantage of all idle hours , till I have honoured you with some <unk> labour .
But if the first heir of my invention prove deformed , I shall be sorry it had so noble a <unk> , and never after ear so barren a land , for fear it yield me still so bad a harvest .
I leave it to your honourable survey , and your honour to your heart ’ s content ; which I wish may always answer your own wish and the world ’ s hopeful expectation .

“ Thrice fairer than myself , ” thus she began , “ The field ’ s chief flower , sweet above compare , <unk> <unk> to all nymphs , more lovely than a man , More white and red than doves or roses are : Nature that made thee , with herself at strife , <unk> that the world hath ending with thy life .

“ And yet not <unk> thy lips with loath ’ d <unk> , But rather famish them <unk> their plenty , <unk> Making them red , and pale , with fresh <unk> : Ten kisses short as one , one long as twenty : A summer ’ s day will seem an hour but short , Being wasted in such <unk> sport . ” <unk> With this she <unk> on his sweating palm , The precedent of <unk> and <unk> , And trembling in her passion , calls it balm , Earth ’ s sovereign salve to do a goddess good : <unk> Being so <unk> ’ d , desire doth lend her force <unk> to pluck him from his horse .
Over one arm the lusty <unk> ’ s rein , Under her other was the tender boy , <unk> Who blush ’ d and <unk> in a dull disdain , With leaden appetite , <unk> to toy ; She red and hot as coals of <unk> fire , He red for shame , but <unk> in desire .
<unk> The <unk> <unk> on a ragged <unk> <unk> she <unk> ; — O !
how quick is love ! — The steed is <unk> up , and even now To tie the rider she begins to prove : <unk> <unk> she push ’ d him , as she would be thrust , And govern ’ d him in strength , though not in lust .
So soon was she along , as he was down , Each <unk> on their <unk> and their <unk> : <unk> Now doth she stroke his cheek , now doth he frown , And ’ gins to chide , but soon she stops his lips , And kissing speaks , with <unk> language broken , “ If thou wilt chide , thy lips shall never open . ” <unk> He burns with <unk> shame , she with her tears Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks ; Then with her <unk> sighs and golden hairs To fan and blow them dry again she seeks .
<unk> He saith she is <unk> , <unk> her miss ; What follows more , she murders with a kiss .
Even as an empty eagle , sharp by fast , <unk> with her <unk> on feathers , flesh and bone , <unk> <unk> her wings , <unk> all in haste , Till either <unk> be stuff ’ d or prey be gone : Even so she kiss ’ d his brow , his cheek , his chin , And where she ends she doth anew begin .
<unk> <unk> ’ d to content , but never to obey , <unk> he lies , and <unk> in her face .
She <unk> on the <unk> , as on a prey , And calls it heavenly <unk> , air of grace , <unk> <unk> her cheeks were <unk> full of flowers So they were dew ’ d with such <unk> showers .
Look how a bird lies <unk> in a net , So <unk> ’ d in her arms Adonis lies ; <unk> <unk> shame and <unk> ’ d <unk> made him fret , Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes : <unk> added to a river that is rank <unk> will force it <unk> the bank .

Still is he sullen , still he <unk> and frets , ’ Twixt crimson shame and anger <unk> pale ; <unk> Being red she loves him best , and being white , Her best is better ’ d with a more delight .
Look how he can , she cannot choose but love ; And by her fair immortal hand she swears , <unk> From his soft bosom never to remove , Till he take truce with her <unk> tears , Which long have rain ’ d , making her cheeks all wet ; And one sweet kiss shall pay this <unk> debt .
Upon this promise did he raise his chin , <unk> Like a <unk> <unk> through a wave , Who , being look ’ d on , <unk> as quickly in ; So offers he to give what she did crave , <unk> But when her lips were ready for his pay , He <unk> , and turns his lips another way .

By law of nature thou art bound to breed , That thine may live when thou thyself art dead ; <unk> And so in spite of death thou dost survive , In that thy likeness still is left alive . ” By this the <unk> queen began to sweat , For where they lay the shadow had forsook them , <unk> And <unk> , tired in the <unk> heat , With burning eye did <unk> <unk> them , <unk> Adonis had his <unk> to guide , So he were like him and by Venus ’ side .
<unk> And now Adonis with a lazy <unk> , And with a heavy , dark , <unk> eye , His <unk> brows o ’ <unk> his fair sight , Like <unk> vapours when they blot the sky , <unk> <unk> his cheeks , cries , “ Fie , no more of love : The sun doth burn my face ; I must remove . ” “ Ay me , ” quoth Venus , “ young , and so unkind !
What bare <unk> mak ’ st thou to be gone !
<unk> I ’ ll sigh celestial breath , whose gentle wind Shall cool the heat of this <unk> sun : I ’ ll make a shadow for thee of my hairs ; If they burn too , I ’ ll quench them with my tears .
<unk> “ The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm , And lo I lie between that sun and thee : The heat I have from thence doth little harm , Thine eye darts forth the fire that <unk> me ; <unk> And were I not immortal , life were done , Between this heavenly and earthly sun .
“ Art thou <unk> , flinty , hard as steel ?
Nay more than flint , for stone at rain <unk> : <unk> Art thou a woman ’ s son and canst not feel What ’ tis to love , how want of love <unk> ?
O had thy mother borne so hard a mind , She had not brought forth thee , but died unkind .
<unk> “ What am I that thou shouldst <unk> me this ?
Or what great danger dwells upon my suit ?
What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss ?
Speak , fair ; but speak fair words , or else be mute : <unk> Give me one kiss , I ’ ll give it thee again , And one for <unk> ’ rest , if thou wilt have twain .
“ Fie , <unk> picture , cold and senseless stone , <unk> idol , image dull and dead , <unk> <unk> <unk> but the eye alone , <unk> like a man , but of no woman bred : Thou art no man , though of a man ’ s complexion , For men will kiss even by their own direction . ” <unk> This said , impatience <unk> her <unk> tongue , And swelling passion doth provoke a pause ; <unk> cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong ; Being judge in love , she cannot right her cause .
<unk> And now she weeps , and now she fain would speak , And now her <unk> do her <unk> break .
Sometimes she shakes her head , and then his hand , Now <unk> she on him , now on the ground ; <unk> Sometimes her arms <unk> him like a band : She would , he will not in her arms be bound ; And when from thence he <unk> to be gone , She locks her lily fingers one in one .
<unk> “ <unk> , ” she saith , “ since I have <unk> ’ d thee here Within the <unk> of this <unk> pale , I ’ ll be a park , and thou shalt be my deer ; Feed where thou wilt , on mountain or in <unk> : <unk> <unk> on my lips , and if those hills be dry , <unk> lower , where the pleasant <unk> lie .
“ Within this limit is relief enough , Sweet bottom grass and high <unk> plain , <unk> <unk> rising <unk> , <unk> obscure and rough , To shelter thee from tempest and from rain : Then be my deer , since I am such a park , <unk> No dog shall rouse thee , though a thousand bark . ” At this Adonis smiles as in disdain , That in each cheek appears a pretty <unk> ; Love made those <unk> , if himself were slain , He might be buried in a tomb so simple ; <unk> <unk> well , if there he came to lie , Why there love liv ’ d , and there he could not die .
These lovely caves , these round <unk> <unk> , Open ’ d their mouths to swallow Venus ’ liking .
<unk> Being mad before , how doth she now for wits ?
<unk> dead at first , what needs a second <unk> ?
Poor queen of love , in thine own law forlorn , To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn !
<unk> Now which way shall she turn ?
what shall she say ?
Her words are done , her woes the more <unk> ; The time is spent , her object will away , And from her <unk> arms doth urge <unk> : <unk> “ Pity , ” she cries ; “ some favour , some remorse ! ” Away he springs , and <unk> to his horse .
But lo from forth a <unk> that neighbours by , A breeding <unk> , lusty , young , and proud , <unk> Adonis ’ <unk> <unk> doth <unk> , And forth she rushes , <unk> and <unk> aloud : The <unk> ’ d steed , being tied unto a tree , <unk> his rein , and to her straight goes he .
<unk> <unk> he <unk> , he <unk> , he bounds , And now his <unk> <unk> he breaks asunder ; The bearing earth with his hard <unk> he wounds , Whose hollow womb <unk> like heaven ’ s thunder ; The iron <unk> he <unk> ’ tween his teeth , <unk> <unk> what he was <unk> with .
His ears <unk> ’ d ; his <unk> hanging <unk> Upon his compass ’ d crest now stand on end ; <unk> His <unk> drink the air , and forth again , As from a <unk> , vapours doth he send : His eye , which <unk> <unk> like fire , Shows his hot courage and his high desire .
<unk> Sometime he <unk> , as if he told the steps , With gentle majesty and modest pride ; Anon he <unk> upright , <unk> and <unk> , As who should say , “ Lo thus my strength is tried ; And this I do to <unk> the eye <unk> Of the fair <unk> that is standing by . ” What <unk> he his rider ’ s angry stir , His flattering “ Holla ” , or his “ Stand , I say ” ?
<unk> What cares he now for curb or <unk> spur ?
For rich <unk> or <unk> gay ?
He sees his love , and nothing else he sees , Nor nothing else with his proud sight <unk> .
<unk> Look when a painter would <unk> the life , In <unk> out a <unk> ’ d steed , His art with nature ’ s <unk> at strife , As if the dead the living should exceed : <unk> So did this horse <unk> a common one , In shape , in courage , colour , pace and bone .
<unk> ’ d , <unk> , <unk> <unk> and long , <unk> breast , full eye , small head , and <unk> wide , High crest , short ears , straight legs and passing strong , <unk> <unk> , thick tail , broad <unk> , tender hide : Look , what a horse should have he did not lack , Save a proud rider on so proud a back .
<unk> Sometimes he <unk> far off , and there he <unk> ; Anon he starts at stirring of a feather : To bid the wind a base he now <unk> , And where he run or fly they know not whether ; <unk> For through his <unk> and tail the high wind sings , <unk> the hairs , who wave like feather ’ d wings .
He looks upon his love , and <unk> unto her ; She answers him as if she knew his mind , <unk> Being proud , as <unk> are , to see him woo her , She puts on outward strangeness , seems unkind , <unk> at his love and scorns the heat he feels , <unk> his kind <unk> with her heels .
<unk> Then like a melancholy <unk> , He <unk> his tail that like a falling <unk> , <unk> shadow to his melting <unk> lent : He <unk> , and bites the poor flies in his <unk> .
<unk> His love , <unk> how he was <unk> ’ d , <unk> <unk> , and his fury was <unk> ’ d .
His testy master <unk> about to take him , When lo the <unk> ’ d <unk> , full of fear , <unk> <unk> of catching , <unk> doth forsake him , With her the horse , and left Adonis there : As they were mad , unto the wood they hie them , <unk> crows that strive to <unk> them .
<unk> All <unk> with <unk> , down Adonis sits , <unk> his boisterous and unruly beast ; And now the happy season once more fits That <unk> love by <unk> may be blest ; <unk> For lovers say , the heart hath treble wrong , When it is barr ’ d the <unk> of the tongue .
An <unk> that is stopp ’ d , or river stay ’ d , <unk> more <unk> , <unk> with more rage : <unk> So of concealed sorrow may be said , Free vent of words love ’ s fire doth <unk> ; But when the heart ’ s <unk> once is mute , The <unk> breaks , as desperate in his suit .
<unk> He sees her coming , and begins to <unk> , Even as a dying coal <unk> with wind , And with his <unk> hides his angry brow , Looks on the dull earth with <unk> mind , <unk> Taking no notice that she is so nigh , For all <unk> he holds her in his eye .
O what a sight it was , <unk> to view How she came stealing to the wayward boy , <unk> To note the fighting conflict of her hue , How white and red each other did destroy : But now her cheek was pale , and by and by It <unk> ’ d forth fire , as lightning from the sky .
<unk> Now was she just before him as he sat , And like a lowly lover down she kneels ; With one fair hand she <unk> up his hat , Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels : <unk> His tend ’ <unk> cheek receives her soft hand ’ s print , As apt as <unk> ’ n snow takes any <unk> .
Oh what a war of looks was then between them , Her eyes <unk> to his eyes <unk> , <unk> His eyes saw her eyes , as they had not seen them , Her eyes woo ’ d still , his eyes disdain ’ d the wooing : And all this dumb play had his acts made plain With tears , which , <unk> , her eyes did rain .
Full gently now she takes him by the hand , <unk> A lily prison ’ d in a gaol of snow , Or <unk> in an <unk> band , So white a friend <unk> so white a foe : <unk> This beauteous combat , wilful and <unk> , Show ’ d like two silver doves that sit <unk> .
Once more the engine of her thoughts began : “ O fairest <unk> on this mortal round , <unk> Would thou wert as I am , and I a man , My heart all whole as thine , thy heart my wound , For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee , Though nothing but my body ’ s <unk> would cure thee . ” “ Give me my hand , ” saith he , “ why dost thou feel it ? ” “ Give me my heart , ” saith she , “ and thou shalt have it .
O give it me lest thy hard heart do steel it , And being steel ’ d , soft sighs can never grave it .
<unk> Then love ’ s deep groans I never shall regard , Because Adonis ’ heart hath made mine hard . ” “ For shame , ” he cries , “ let go , and let me go , My day ’ s delight is past , my horse is gone , <unk> And ’ tis your fault I am bereft him so , I pray you hence , and leave me here alone , For all my mind , my thought , my busy care , Is how to get my <unk> from the <unk> . ” <unk> Thus she replies : “ Thy <unk> as he should , <unk> the warm approach of sweet desire , <unk> is a coal that must be cool ’ d ; Else , suffer ’ d , it will set the heart on fire , <unk> The sea hath bounds , but deep desire hath none ; Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone .
“ How like a jade he stood tied to the tree , <unk> master ’ d with a <unk> rein !
<unk> But when he saw his love , his youth ’ s fair fee , He held such petty bondage in disdain ; <unk> the base <unk> from his bending crest , <unk> his mouth , his back , his breast .
<unk> “ Who sees his <unk> in her naked bed , <unk> the sheets a <unk> hue than white , But when his <unk> eye so full hath fed , His other <unk> aim at like delight ?
<unk> Who is so faint that dare not be so bold To touch the fire , the weather being cold ?
“ Let me excuse thy <unk> , gentle boy , And learn of him , I heartily beseech thee , <unk> To take advantage on presented joy , Though I were dumb , yet his proceedings teach thee .
O learn to love , the <unk> is but plain , And once made perfect , never lost again . ” <unk> “ I know not love , ” quoth he , “ nor will not know it , Unless it be a boar , and then I chase it ; ’ Tis much to borrow , and I will not owe it ; My love to love is love but to disgrace it ; <unk> For I have heard , it is a life in death , That laughs and weeps , and all but with a breath .
“ Who wears a garment <unk> and <unk> ’ d ?
Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth ?
<unk> If <unk> things be any jot <unk> ’ d , They wither in their prime , prove nothing worth ; The <unk> that ’ s back ’ d and burden ’ d being young , <unk> his pride , and never <unk> strong .
<unk> “ You hurt my hand with <unk> .
Let us part , And leave this idle theme , this bootless chat : <unk> your siege from my <unk> heart , To love ’ s <unk> it will not ope the gate : <unk> <unk> your vows , your <unk> tears , your <unk> ’ ry ; For where a heart is hard they make no <unk> ’ ry . ” “ What !
canst thou talk ? ” quoth she , “ hast thou a tongue ?
O would thou hadst not , or I had no hearing ; <unk> Thy <unk> ’ s voice hath done me double wrong ; I had my load before , now press ’ d with bearing : <unk> discord , heavenly tune , <unk> , <unk> ’ s deep sweet music , and heart ’ s deep sore <unk> .
“ Had I no eyes but ears , my ears would love <unk> That inward beauty and invisible ; Or were I deaf , thy outward parts would move Each part in me that were but sensible : <unk> Though neither eyes nor ears , to hear nor see , Yet should I be in love by touching thee .
“ Say that the sense of feeling were bereft me , And that I could not see , nor hear , nor touch , <unk> And nothing but the very smell were left me , Yet would my love to thee be still as much ; For from the <unk> of thy face <unk> Comes breath <unk> ’ d , that <unk> love by <unk> .
“ But <unk> what banquet wert thou to the taste , <unk> Being nurse and <unk> of the other four ; Would they not wish the feast might ever last , And bid suspicion <unk> the door , Lest jealousy , that sour <unk> guest , Should by his stealing in disturb the feast ? ” <unk> Once more the <unk> ’ d <unk> open ’ d , Which to his speech did honey passage yield , <unk> Like a red morn that ever yet <unk> ’ d <unk> to the <unk> , tempest to the field , Sorrow to shepherds , woe unto the birds , <unk> and foul <unk> to <unk> and to <unk> .
<unk> This ill <unk> <unk> she <unk> : Even as the wind is hush ’ d before it <unk> , Or as the wolf doth <unk> before he <unk> , Or as the <unk> breaks before it <unk> , <unk> Or like the deadly <unk> of a <unk> , His meaning struck her ere his words begun .
And at his look she <unk> <unk> down For looks kill love , and love by looks <unk> ; <unk> A smile <unk> the <unk> of a frown ; But blessed <unk> , that by love so <unk> !
The silly boy , <unk> she is dead , <unk> her pale cheek , till <unk> makes it red .
<unk> And all amaz ’ d brake off his late intent , For <unk> he did think to <unk> her , Which cunning love did <unk> prevent : Fair fall the wit that can so well defend her !
<unk> For on the grass she lies as she were slain , Till his breath <unk> life in her again .
He <unk> her nose , he strikes her on the cheeks , He <unk> her fingers , holds her <unk> hard , <unk> He <unk> her lips ; a thousand ways he seeks To mend the hurt that his unkindness marr ’ d : He kisses her ; and she , by her good will , Will never rise , so he will kiss her still .
<unk> The night of sorrow now is turn ’ d to day : Her two blue windows faintly she <unk> , Like the fair sun when in his fresh array He <unk> the morn , and all the world <unk> : <unk> And as the bright sun <unk> the sky , So is her face <unk> ’ d with her eye .
Whose beams upon his <unk> face are fix ’ d , As if from thence they borrow ’ d all their shine .
<unk> Were never four such <unk> together <unk> ’ d , Had not his <unk> with his brow ’ s <unk> ; But hers , which through the crystal tears gave light <unk> like the moon in water seen by night .
<unk> “ O where am I ? ” quoth she , “ in earth or heaven ?

Do I delight to die , or life desire ?
<unk> But now I liv ’ d , and life was death ’ s annoy ; But now I died , and death was lively joy .
“ O thou didst kill me ; kill me once again : Thy eyes ’ shrewd tutor , that hard heart of thine , <unk> Hath taught them scornful tricks , and such disdain , That they have murder ’ d this poor heart of mine ; And these mine eyes , true <unk> to their queen , But for thy piteous lips no more had seen .

<unk> “ A thousand kisses buys my heart from me ; And pay them at thy leisure , one by one , What is ten hundred touches unto thee ?
Are they not quickly told and quickly gone ?
<unk> Say , for <unk> that the debt should double , Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble ? ” “ Fair queen , ” quoth he , “ if any love you owe me , <unk> my strangeness with my <unk> years : <unk> Before I know myself , seek not to know me ; No <unk> but the <unk> <unk> <unk> : The <unk> <unk> doth fall , the green sticks fast , Or being early pluck ’ d , is sour to taste .
<unk> “ Look the world ’ s <unk> , with weary gait His day ’ s hot task hath ended in the west ; The owl , night ’ s herald , <unk> , ’ tis very late ; The sheep are gone to fold , birds to their nest , <unk> And <unk> clouds that shadow heaven ’ s light Do summon us to part , and bid good night .

<unk> Foul words and frowns must not <unk> a lover ; What though the rose have <unk> , yet ’ tis pluck ’ d .

“ Sweet boy , ” she says , “ this night I ’ ll waste in sorrow , For my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch .
<unk> Tell me , love ’ s master , shall we meet tomorrow Say , shall we ?
shall we ?
wilt thou make the match ? ” He tells her no , tomorrow he intends To hunt the boar with certain of his friends .
<unk> “ The boar ! ” quoth she ; <unk> a sudden pale , Like <unk> being spread upon the blushing rose , <unk> her cheek , she trembles at his tale , And on his neck her <unk> arms she throws .
<unk> She <unk> down , still hanging by his neck , He on her belly falls , she on her back .
Now is she in the very lists of love , Her champion mounted for the hot encounter : <unk> All is imaginary she doth prove , He will not manage her , although he mount her ; That worse than <unk> ’ is her annoy , To clip <unk> and to lack her joy .
<unk> Even as poor birds , deceiv ’ d with painted <unk> , Do surfeit by the eye and pine the <unk> : Even so she <unk> in her <unk> , As those poor birds that <unk> <unk> saw .

“ Fie , fie , ” he says , “ you crush me ; let me go ; You have no reason to <unk> me so . ” <unk> “ Thou hadst been gone , ” quoth she , “ sweet boy , ere this , But that thou told ’ st me thou wouldst hunt the boar .

Would root these beauties as he roots the <unk> .
“ Oh let him keep his loathsome cabin still , <unk> Beauty hath naught to do with such foul fiends : Come not within his danger by thy will ; They that thrive well , take counsel of their friends .
When thou didst name the boar , not to dissemble , I fear ’ d thy fortune , and my joints did tremble .

<unk> “ And more than so , <unk> to mine eye The picture of an angry <unk> boar , Under whose sharp <unk> on his back doth lie An image like thyself , all stain ’ d with gore ; <unk> Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed , Doth make them <unk> with grief and hang the head .

<unk> “ Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep , To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell , And sometime where <unk> <unk> keep , To stop the loud <unk> in their <unk> , <unk> And sometime <unk> with a herd of deer ; <unk> <unk> <unk> , wit waits on fear .
“ For there his smell with others being mingled , <unk> The hot <unk> hounds are driven to doubt , <unk> their clamorous cry , till they have <unk> With much ado the cold fault <unk> out ; Then do they spend their mouths : <unk> replies , As if another chase were in the skies .
<unk> “ By this , poor <unk> , far off upon a hill , Stands on his hinder legs with list ’ ning ear , To <unk> if his foes pursue him still .

Look how a bright star <unk> from the sky , So <unk> he in the night from Venus ’ eye .
<unk> Which after him she darts , as one on shore <unk> upon a late <unk> friend , Till the wild waves will have him seen no more , Whose <unk> with the meeting clouds contend : <unk> So did the <unk> and <unk> night <unk> in the object that did feed her sight .
Whereat amaz ’ d , as one that <unk> Hath <unk> ’ d a precious jewel in the flood , <unk> Or ’ <unk> ’ d as <unk> often are , Their light blown out in some <unk> wood ; Even so confounded in the dark she lay , Having lost the fair discovery of her way .
<unk> And now she beats her heart , <unk> it groans , That all the neighbour caves , as seeming troubled , Make <unk> repetition of her <unk> ; <unk> on passion deeply is <unk> : <unk> “ Ay me ! ” she cries , and twenty times , “ Woe , woe ! ” And twenty <unk> twenty times cry so .
She <unk> them , begins a <unk> note , And sings <unk> a woeful <unk> ; <unk> How love makes young men thrall , and old men dote , How love is wise in folly foolish witty : Her heavy <unk> still <unk> in woe , And still the <unk> of <unk> answer so .
<unk> Her song was tedious , and <unk> the night , For lovers ’ hours are long , though seeming short , If pleas ’ d themselves , others they think , delight In such like circumstance , with such like sport : <unk> Their <unk> stories <unk> begun , <unk> without audience , and are never done .
For who hath she to spend the night withal , But idle sounds <unk> <unk> ; <unk> Like <unk> ’ d <unk> <unk> every call , <unk> the humour of <unk> wits ?
She says , “ ’ Tis so : ” they answer all , “ ’ Tis so ; ” And would say after her , if she said “ No . ” <unk> Lo here the gentle lark , weary of rest , From his moist <unk> <unk> up on high , And wakes the morning , from whose silver breast The sun <unk> in his majesty ; <unk> Who doth the world so <unk> behold , That cedar tops and hills seem <unk> ’ d gold .
Venus <unk> him with this fair good morrow : “ Oh thou clear god , and patron of all light , <unk> From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow The beauteous influence that makes him bright , There lives a son that suck ’ d an earthly mother , May lend thee light , as thou dost lend to other . ” This said , she <unk> to a <unk> grove , <unk> <unk> the morning is so much o ’ <unk> , And yet she hears no tidings of her love ; She <unk> for his hounds and for his horn .
<unk> Anon she hears them <unk> it <unk> , And all in haste she <unk> to the cry .
And as she runs , the <unk> in the way Some catch her by the neck , some kiss her face , <unk> Some <unk> about her thigh to make her stay : She wildly <unk> from their strict embrace , Like a <unk> doe , whose swelling <unk> do ache , <unk> to feed her fawn hid in some brake .
<unk> By this she hears the hounds are at a bay , Whereat she starts like one that spies an adder <unk> ’ d up in fatal <unk> just in his way , The fear whereof doth make him shake and <unk> ; <unk> Even so the timorous <unk> of the hounds <unk> her senses , and her spirit confounds .
For now she knows it is no gentle chase , But the blunt boar , rough bear , or lion proud , <unk> Because the cry <unk> in one place , Where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud , Finding their enemy to be so curst , They all strain court ’ <unk> who shall cope him first .
<unk> This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear , Through which it enters to surprise her heart ; Who overcome by doubt and <unk> fear , With <unk> weakness <unk> each feeling part ; <unk> Like soldiers when their captain once doth yield , They basely fly and dare not stay the field .
Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy , Till <unk> up her senses sore dismay ’ d , <unk> She tells them ’ tis a <unk> fantasy , And childish error , that they are afraid ; <unk> them leave <unk> , bids them fear no more : And with that word , she spied the <unk> boar .
<unk> Whose <unk> mouth <unk> all with red , Like milk and blood being mingled both together , A second fear through all her sinews spread , Which madly <unk> her she knows not whither : <unk> This way she runs , and now she will no further , But back retires , to rate the boar for <unk> .
A thousand <unk> bear her a thousand ways , She treads the path that she <unk> again ; <unk> Her more than haste is <unk> with delays , Like the proceedings of a drunken brain , Full of respects , yet naught at all <unk> , In hand with all things , naught at all <unk> .
Here <unk> ’ d in a brake she finds a hound , <unk> And <unk> the weary caitiff for his master , And there another <unk> of his wound , ’ Gainst venom ’ d sores the only sovereign <unk> .
<unk> And here she meets another sadly <unk> , To whom she speaks , and he replies with howling .
When he hath <unk> ’ d his <unk> noise , Another <unk> ’ d <unk> , black and grim , <unk> Against the welkin <unk> out his voice ; Another and another answer him , <unk> their proud <unk> to the ground below , <unk> their scratch ’ d ears , bleeding as they go .
Look how the world ’ s poor people are amazed <unk> At <unk> , signs , and <unk> , Whereon with fearful eyes they long have <unk> , <unk> them with dreadful prophecies ; <unk> So she at these sad sighs draws up her breath , And sighing it again , <unk> on death .
“ <unk> ’ d tyrant , ugly , <unk> , lean , <unk> <unk> divorce of love , ” thus chides she death , “ <unk> ghost , earth ’ s worm , what dost thou mean ?
To <unk> beauty and to steal his breath , Who when he liv ’ d , his breath and beauty set <unk> on the rose , smell to the violet .
<unk> “ If he be dead , O no , it cannot be , Seeing his beauty , thou shouldst strike at it , O yes , it may , thou hast no eyes to see , But <unk> at <unk> dost thou hit .
<unk> Thy mark is feeble age , but thy false dart <unk> that aim , and <unk> an infant ’ s heart .
“ Hadst thou but bid beware , then he had spoke , And hearing him , thy power had lost his power .
<unk> The <unk> will curse thee for this stroke ; They bid thee crop a weed , thou pluck ’ st a flower .
Love ’ s golden arrow at him should have fled , And not death ’ s <unk> dart to strike him dead .
<unk> “ Dost thou drink tears , that thou <unk> ’ st such weeping ?
What may a heavy groan advantage thee ?
Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see ?
<unk> Now nature cares not for thy mortal vigour , Since her best work is ruin ’ d with thy rigour . ” Here overcome , as one full of despair , She <unk> ’ d her eyelids , who like <unk> stopp ’ d <unk> The crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair In the sweet channel of her bosom <unk> ’ d But through the <unk> breaks the silver rain , And with his strong course <unk> them again .
<unk> O how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow ; Her eyes seen in the tears , tears in her eye ; Both <unk> , where they view ’ d each other ’ s sorrow , Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry ; <unk> But like a <unk> day , now wind , now rain , <unk> dry her cheeks , tears make them wet again .
<unk> passions throng her constant woe , As <unk> who should best become her grief ; <unk> All entertain ’ d , each passion labours so , That every present sorrow seemeth chief , But none is best , then join they all together , Like many clouds <unk> for foul weather .
<unk> By this , far off she hears some <unk> <unk> ; A nurse ’ s song ne ’ er pleas ’ d her babe so well : The dire imagination she did follow This sound of hope doth labour to <unk> ; <unk> For now <unk> joy bids her rejoice , And <unk> her it is Adonis ’ voice .
Whereat her tears began to turn their tide , Being prison ’ d in her eye , like pearls in glass ; <unk> Yet sometimes falls an <unk> drop beside , Which her cheek <unk> , as <unk> it should pass To wash the foul face of the <unk> ground , Who is but drunken when she seemeth drown ’ d .
O <unk> love , how strange it seems <unk> Not to believe , and yet too credulous ; Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes ; Despair and hope make thee ridiculous , <unk> The one doth flatter thee in thoughts <unk> , In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly .
Now she <unk> the web that she hath wrought , Adonis lives , and death is not to blame ; <unk> It was not she that call ’ d him all to naught ; Now she <unk> honours to his hateful name .
She <unk> him king of graves , and grave for kings , <unk> supreme of all mortal things .
<unk> “ No , no , ” quoth she , “ sweet death , I did but jest ; Yet pardon me , I felt a kind of fear <unk> I met the boar , that bloody beast , Which knows no pity , but is still severe ; <unk> Then , gentle shadow , — truth I must confess — I rail ’ d on thee , fearing my love ’ s <unk> .
“ ’ Tis not my fault , the boar <unk> ’ d my tongue ; Be <unk> ’ d on him , invisible commander ; <unk> ’ Tis he , foul creature , that hath done thee wrong ; I did but act , he ’ s author of my slander .
Grief hath two tongues , and never woman yet , Could rule them both , without ten women ’ s wit . ” Thus <unk> that Adonis is alive , <unk> Her rash suspect she doth <unk> ; And that his beauty may the better thrive , With death she humbly doth <unk> ; <unk> <unk> him of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and stories His <unk> , his triumphs and his glories .
“ O love ! ” quoth she , “ how much a fool was I , To be of such a weak and silly mind , <unk> To wail his death who lives , and must not die Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind ; For he being dead , with him is beauty slain , And beauty dead , black <unk> comes again .
<unk> “ Fie , fie , fond love , thou art as full of fear As one with treasure <unk> , <unk> ’ d with thieves , <unk> <unk> with eye or ear , Thy coward heart with false <unk> grieves . ” <unk> Even at this word she hears a merry horn , Whereat she <unk> that was but late forlorn .
As falcon to the <unk> , away she flies ; The grass <unk> not , she treads on it so light , <unk> And in her haste <unk> spies The foul boar ’ s conquest on her fair delight ; Which seen , her eyes , as murder ’ d with the view , Like stars asham ’ d of day , themselves <unk> .
Or as the <unk> , whose tender horns being hit , <unk> <unk> <unk> in his <unk> cave with pain , And there all smother ’ d up , in shade doth sit , Long after fearing to creep forth again : <unk> So at his bloody view her eyes are fled Into the deep dark <unk> of her head .
Where they resign their office and their light To the <unk> of her troubled brain , <unk> Who bids them still consort with ugly night , And never wound the heart with looks again ; Who like a king <unk> in his throne , By their suggestion gives a deadly groan .
<unk> Whereat each <unk> subject <unk> , As when the wind imprison ’ d in the ground , <unk> for passage , earth ’ s <unk> shakes , Which with cold terror doth men ’ s minds confound .
This mutiny each part doth so surprise <unk> That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes .
And being open ’ d , threw <unk> light Upon the wide wound that the boar had <unk> ’ d In his soft <unk> , whose wonted lily white <unk> With purple tears that his wound wept , was drench ’ d .
No flower was nigh , no grass , herb , leaf or weed , But stole his blood and seem ’ d with him to bleed .
This solemn sympathy poor Venus <unk> , <unk> Over one shoulder doth she hang her head , <unk> she passions , <unk> she <unk> ; She thinks he could not die , he is not dead : <unk> Her voice is stopp ’ d , her joints forget to bow , Her eyes are mad , that they have wept till now .
Upon his hurt she looks so <unk> , That her sight <unk> makes the wound seem three ; And then she <unk> her <unk> eye , <unk> That makes more <unk> , where no breach should be : His face seems twain , each several limb is <unk> , For oft the eye <unk> , the brain being troubled .
“ My tongue cannot express my grief for one , <unk> And yet , ” quoth she , “ behold two <unk> dead !
My sighs are blown away , my salt tears gone , Mine eyes are turn ’ d to fire , my heart to lead : <unk> <unk> heart ’ s lead , melt at mine eyes ’ red fire !
So shall I die by drops of hot desire .
“ Alas poor world , what treasure hast thou lost !
What face remains alive that ’ s worth the <unk> ?
Whose tongue is music now ?
what canst thou boast Of things long since , or anything ensuing ?
<unk> The flowers are sweet , their colours fresh and trim , But true sweet beauty liv ’ d and died with him .
“ <unk> nor veil henceforth no creature wear !
<unk> Nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you : Having no fair to lose , you need not fear ; The sun doth scorn you , and the wind doth hiss you .
But when Adonis liv ’ d , sun and sharp air <unk> <unk> ’ d like two thieves , to rob him of his fair .
“ And therefore would he put his <unk> on , Under whose <unk> the gaudy sun would peep ; <unk> The wind would blow it off , and being gone , Play with his locks ; then would Adonis weep ; And straight , in pity of his tender years , They both would strive who first should dry his tears .
“ To see his face the lion walk ’ d along <unk> Behind some hedge , because he would not fear him ; To <unk> himself when he hath sung , The tiger would be tame and gently hear him .
<unk> If he had spoke , the wolf would leave his prey , And never fright the silly lamb that day .
“ When he beheld his shadow in the brook , The fishes spread on it their golden <unk> ; <unk> When he was by , the birds such pleasure took , That some would sing , some other in their bills Would bring him <unk> and <unk> <unk> , He fed them with his sight , they him with <unk> .
“ But this foul , grim , and <unk> boar , <unk> Whose <unk> eye still <unk> for a grave , Ne ’ er saw the beauteous livery that he wore ; Witness the entertainment that he gave .
<unk> If he did see his face , why then I know He thought to kiss him , and hath kill ’ d him so .
“ ’ Tis true , ’ tis true ; thus was Adonis slain : He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear , <unk> Who did not whet his teeth at him again , But by a kiss thought to persuade him there ; And <unk> in his <unk> , the loving swine <unk> ’ d <unk> the <unk> in his soft <unk> .
<unk> “ Had I been tooth ’ d like him , I must confess , With kissing him I should have kill ’ d him first ; But he is dead , and never did he bless My youth with his ; the more am I <unk> . ” <unk> With this she <unk> in the place she stood , And <unk> her face with his <unk> blood .
She looks upon his lips , and they are pale ; She takes him by the hand , and that is cold , <unk> She whispers in his ears a heavy tale , As if they heard the woeful words she told ; She <unk> the <unk> that close his eyes , Where lo , two <unk> burnt out in darkness lies .
Two glasses where herself herself beheld <unk> A thousand times , and now no more <unk> ; Their virtue lost , wherein they late <unk> ’ d , And every beauty robb ’ d of his effect .
<unk> “ <unk> of time , ” quoth she , “ this is my spite , That thou being dead , the day should yet be light .
“ Since thou art dead , lo here I prophesy , Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend : <unk> It shall be <unk> on with jealousy , Find sweet beginning , but <unk> end ; Ne ’ er settled equally , but high or low , That all love ’ s pleasure shall not match his woe .
“ It shall be fickle , false and full of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and be blasted in a breathing while ; The bottom poison , and the top o ’ <unk> ’ d With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile .
<unk> The strongest body shall it make most weak , Strike the wise dumb , and teach the fool to speak .
“ It shall be <unk> , and too full of riot , <unk> <unk> age to tread the measures ; <unk> The <unk> ruffian shall it keep in quiet , Pluck down the rich , enrich the poor with <unk> ; It shall be raging mad , and silly mild , Make the young old , the old become a child .
<unk> “ It shall suspect where is no cause of fear , It shall not fear where it should most mistrust ; It shall be merciful , and too severe , And most <unk> when it seems most just ; <unk> <unk> it shall be , where it shows most toward , Put fear to valour , courage to the coward .
“ It shall be cause of war and dire events , And set dissension ’ twixt the son and sire ; <unk> <unk> and servile to all <unk> , As dry <unk> matter is to fire , <unk> in his prime death doth my love destroy , They that love best their love shall not enjoy . ” <unk> By this the boy that by her side lay kill ’ d Was melted like a vapour from her sight , And in his blood that on the ground lay <unk> ’ d , A purple flower sprung up , <unk> ’ d with white , <unk> <unk> well his pale cheeks , and the blood Which in round drops upon their <unk> stood .
She bows her head , the <unk> flower to smell , <unk> it to her Adonis ’ breath ; <unk> And says within her bosom it shall dwell , Since he himself is <unk> from her by death ; She drops the <unk> , and in the breach appears <unk> sap , which she <unk> to tears .
